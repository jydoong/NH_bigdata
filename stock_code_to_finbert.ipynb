      "Two stocks on the rise are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), increasing between 6% to 16% since the start of the year. These companies have become direct competitors in the streaming industry in recent years but remain vastly different businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "With shares in these tech giants on their way up, you might consider investing now before they get any higher. So is Apple or Netflix's stock the better buy? Let's assess.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has recently featured in numerous headlines since the start of the year as analysts speculate on its future roadmap and the company releases new products. So far in 2023, Apple has announced upgrades to its MacBook Pro utilizing its new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, a beefier Mac mini, and a second-generation HomePod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, rumors about the company's longer-term plans have investors rallying, with its stock rising 6% year to date. Tech analysts have revealed Apple is developing a mixed-reality headset that will likely release in 2023, considering $99 AirPods within the next two years, and making moves to control more of its production line with in-house screens and telecom chips. Each of these developments has the potential to provide boosts to revenue and Apple's stock over the long haul.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's becoming more and more evident that Apple hopes to reduce its reliance on other tech companies over the next two years, with Bloomberg reporting it will begin using custom-designed screens in its iPhones as early as 2024. The change will free it from costly partnerships with Samsung and LG Display. As Apple already uses custom chips in the iPhone, screens are the single most expensive component. As a result, developing in-house displays would be incredibly lucrative over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to screens, Apple has plans to swap out telecom chips from Qualcomm and Broadcom with custom versions as it further seeks to increase iPhone profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone accounted for 52% of Apple's revenue in 2022. So while other segments are on the rise, diversifying the company's revenue, it's promising that Apple is prioritizing maximizing profits in its crucial smartphone business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Online service-based revenue from subscriptions can be lucrative in many industries; however, fierce competition in streaming has made it difficult to rely on a high membership count. The company would do well to broaden its offerings as Apple has done with its many services, including Apple TV+, Music, Fitness+, News+, iCloud, and Arcade. In doing so, Netflix would strengthen its business model and have the option to offer a bundled subscription which is less likely to be dropped on a whim.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, if you're looking to invest in the streaming industry, Apple is the safer bet. The tech star is home to some of the world's most in-demand products, with its booming services business also offering the swiftly growing streaming platform Apple TV+. With Apple and Disney biting at its heels, Netflix's future is too murky to count on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, compare Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22 and free cash flow of $111.4 billion against Netflix's P/E of 34 and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. These significantly healthier metrics make Apple's stock a significantly better buy.\n",

      "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has seen its share price fall by 15% during this time. But that shouldn't scare off investors. The company still has a lot going for it, and there are several reasons you should consider this a buying opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's customers remain very loyal to the brand. Getting customers to keep coming back remains encouraging. After all, what's a better testament for a company?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's iPhone continues to take market share from rival smartphone makers. In the U.S., it now accounts for more than 50% of smartphones used.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the company certainly has other products, iPhones account for a large portion of Apple's sales. In its latest fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 24, 2022, iPhones were 52% of the company's top line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple released a new iPhone version in September. Although it was only sold for less than a month, fourth-quarter sales of the devices increased by 9.7% to $42.7 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "While iPhones represent the biggest slice of the sales pie, Apple has other growth areas. This includes services, such as advertising, technical support, and the App Store. As the second biggest source of sales, it grew by 5% in the latest quarter to $19.2 billion. While sales growth slowed from earlier in the year, management blamed it on temporary factors such as foreign currency exchange translations. On a constant currency basis, it said sales rose by double digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also spent $14.8 billion on dividends. While the 0.7% dividend yield trails the S&P 500's 1.7%, Apple has raised the dividend payment annually since 2012. That includes last April, when it increased the quarterly payout by 5% to $0.23.\n",

Specifically, I'm talking about tech-focused CEFs--which we're getting a nice second chance to buy thanks to last week's earnings whiffs from the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Buying a tech CEF is like buying an ETF that focuses on technology, but with two key differences: Big dividends: the CEF we're going to analyze today yields 12.1%--and it pays dividends monthly, too. You and I know that both of these things are unheard of in the world of \"regular\" stocks and funds. Big discounts: This fund sports a 12.2% discount to net asset value (NAV)--CEF-speak for saying that we'll pay just 88 cents for every dollar of its assets!

This isn't surprising given its portfolio. Despite tech's struggles last year, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) have been tremendous long-term outperformers. They're also BST's top positions, and these, in addition to the fund's investments across the tech world, caused the line in the chart above to go up and to the right for years. While it doesn't necessarily follow that BSTZ can do the same, this is one more encouraging sign. A Quick Guide to Sustainable CEF Dividends There's another strategy you can use to see if a CEF's payouts are likely to stay where they are or go up, or if there's a risk of a dividend cut. The key is to look back at the fund's long-term total NAV return (or the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends) and compare it to the fund's payout. This calculation is a good first step in determining whether a CEF can maintain its current payout level. This Chart Is the Key to BSTZ's Dividend Future\n",

In fact, its annual report for 2022 doesn't mention artificial intelligence or machine learning even a single time.

      "Nick Sciple: Yeah. A few things. High-level, A, teens still spending money in this slowing down economy where you see maybe pressures on some retailers still seeing teens spending self-reported up 2% year over year within that context, teens still spending but spending in different channels. One channel I've been watching in particular is the secondhand channel. I see over 200 basis points increase in preferences year over year. That's something if you were paying attention back in January, the National Retail Federation held their big show every year for all big retailers across the country. One of the big areas of growth highlighted among those folks was resale expected to grow 3 times faster than core retail moving forward. A lot of that being driven by preferences among younger folks, Gen Z, things like that. Also, as far as brand preferences, it's just that the big brands that you would expect to be dominant continue to dominate. So if you look at the top five most popular e-commerce websites, obviously Amazon coming in at No. 1, but also interesting to see companies like Nike and Lululemon through their direct-to-consumer channels, really having lots of success. Apple still remains the dominant smartphone. You have 87% of teens report owning an iPhone, 88% of them expect to own an iPhone next year. The kids generation, we're addicted the millennials to the iPhone. It looks like Gen Z is addicted as well.\n",

I look at some of the names on this and the leaders in some of these categories. You mentioned Nike, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube leading the way in terms of video habits, and I think it's a good reminder if you're trying to be somewhat somatic and how you're looking at things like this and how you're trying to apply it to your portfolio. You don't necessarily need to be awarded style points or points for difficulty when you're trying to project what the future looks like.

Had been a paid user for probably six or seven years, and I have not once thought about my subscription since.

The five in order we're going to be talking about Activision Blizzard, and then AeroVironment, Airbnb, Apple, and Axon Enterprise. Those are the five stocks we're checking with. Again this is a three-year journey and we're just at the end of Year 2. They have a year to improve their performance. Let's kick it off with Activision Blizzard. Jason, this stock two years ago, 96.84, $96 a share or so today 85. The stock is down 12 percent. Now the S&P 500 is up 1.1 percent. That's the bogey we're competing against. Jason Moser, the market has been basically flat over these last two years, up one percent, the stock down 12 percent. What hasn't been happening at Activision Blizzard headquarters?\n",

Everything that we've said is out there forever, so we're on record here and we're never going to make a short-term prediction, and arguably even a three-year game of the five-stock sampler is a shorter-term game than we actually play in our portfolio. That makes it a little bit more of a fun game, but Airbnb you and I both like here at $114.62 which is where it's trading as we speak here on Tuesday, April 11th. Well, let's move on to the last two, Jason and speaking of companies that pass the snap test. Stock number four alphabetically, I don't know if you've ever heard of these guys before Apple.\n",

Apple was at $127.90 two years ago, this week it's now up to 161.5, so the stock's up 26 percent with the market up one percent that gives us a plus 25. By the way, I did account for Airbnb but when you add it in the minus 37 that Airbnb was bringing into this five-stock sampler. We were at 58 percentage points in total underwater, so getting back 25, thanks to Apple outperforming the market by 25 percentage points, sparks joy.\n",

I mean, you talk about your snap test, this is leading the pack, this is it. Apple to me, it's like pizza. I mean, it's not always going to be great. Like any other company in the world will witness times that are more challenging and others, it's not always going to be great, but you know what? Hey, it's still pizza, and hey this is still Apple. Even when Apple witnesses challenging times, it's still Apple. Let's not forget that. I mean, you look at the holiday season that they just turned in, I think many would probably focus on the fact that revenue was actually down five percent for the quarter, and to think of a company like Apple with revenue actually shrinking, wow, what happened? Well, as we said before with AeroVironment, they're not immune to the supply chain issues. They're not immune to inflationary concerns and what not, and so they have dealt with those challenges but the good news is, while revenue was down five percent for the quarter, that was still $117 billion of revenue that they chalked up for one single core.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: It's tremendous ecosystem and you can be a little bit of an Apple user or you can be a lot of an Apple user. I mean, I have an iPhone and I have a Windows laptop, but everything works together. We've got some Amazon devices in our house, I mean, the beauty of Apple and I think you really keyed on it there with the services for the longest time we've recognized app was primarily a phone company. That's where most of the money came from but slowly they've really done a great job of diversifying away from just being the phone. They now have an installed base of over two billion devices around the world. I mean that's just astounding to think about, and ultimately what that allows them to do is grow that services business. That services business recorded revenue of just under $21 billion for the quarter that was up six percent from the prior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: It typically is. I think the nice thing about Apple is it's so premium. It's such good stuff. They are able to maintain some good pricing on that hardware as well. Well, you see a lot of companies hardware is a little bit of a race to the bottom, and with Apple, it's not really that way which I think gives it a little bit of extra staying power there. But in regard to services, they have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across all of the services on their platform now, that's up more than 150 million during the prior 12 months, and it's nearly four times what they had just five years ago. So you're seeing the results of all of these investments into growing that ecosystem beyond hardware. Along the way, they've been very shareholder-friendly. They continue to repurchase shares. Share counts down 16 percent since 2018. That'll continue. While the dividend yield today, which is under one percent. Sure that seems modest. Let's take the glass-half-full approach here, David, in understanding that that dividend yield will continue to grow over time as well, so even big companies can still continue to grow and reward shareholders,.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Gardner: Two more things to say about Apple before we move on to the final stock, which for the record is Axon Enterprise, and I'm smiling about that, we'll talk about the numbers in a sec. But I'd like to just note that Apple, first of all, as a market cap, is literally 1,000 times AeroVironment, so AeroVironment is about 2.5 billion and Apple is about 2.5 trillion, and that leads to the second point, which, and I think this is very instructive since these are Jason and everyone listening, five stocks to teach Rule Breakers. I think one thing we can all learn is that there is a connection between what I think of as the world's greatest brand and the world's just about greatest stock performer over the course of now, more than a couple of decades. Those things are tied together. I truly believe that companies with great brands are often mistaken for one thing, brand doesn't really show up on the financial statements. I mean, you can do some goodwill if it gets acquired, this or that, but the things that are invisible to people who are looking at the financial statements or dialing their computer algorithms to look for certain numbers, or ratios, they're missing brand, and yet the companies that often have the greatest brands often, and Apple is a great example, are the greatest stocks that you could hold over the course of a long period of time. So Apple is front and center for me, one of those exemplars that do teach Rule Breakers a stock that we've had in our services for well more than 10 years now and a lot of happy Motley Fool members owning Apple. I'm happy to say Jason, as we go here to close with Axon Enterprise that Apple has been a stock that you wanted to hold these last couple of years. The market again up one percent, Apple up 26 percent. Let's close with Axon Enterprise ticker symbol A-X-O-N. Axon Enterprise was at $147.27 a share when I picked it on this podcast on April 7, two years ago, it's gone from 147-225, just about even. That's up 53 percent. I'm going to ask you that in a sec, but to account for the numbers here, that 53 percent gain minus the markets one percent gives me a plus 52. That's exactly what I need for this five-stock sampler to be beating the market two years in now, let's be real clear. This game is not over. It will not be over for another year. I personally, I'm pretty bullish on a number of these companies, so we'll see how it plays out. I'm also excited because what's coming after you, which is Jim Mueller talking about my worst five-stock sampler ever. I am celebrating. I'm looking for the light right now and basking in it with my friend in his green masters jacket with a shirt right across the mic from me. But Jason, what's been happening for Axon Enterprise?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: Yeah. I think the neat thing about Axon, this is a top dog, which I know is a trade of a Rule Breaker. This is a top dog and you really can't I don't think anyone can really name off the top of their head the closest competitor to Axon, they really do own this market. I think that's given them the leeway to be a little bit patient in how they develop this business. I think a lot of the strong performance is really coming from not only this market-leading position, but a strong and growing recurring revenue dynamic. There's not just the hardware side of the business, but there's the software and the services that they're providing a law enforcement so they can keep track of what's going on and add that visual documented proof that they may need in certain cases. You go back to April of 2021, annual recurring software revenue at the time it was $242 million, which represented 39 percent growth from prior year. You go to 2021 for the full year beyond just April, that full year of 2021, that recurring revenue was up to 327. A million dollars, 2022, they grew that revenue up to better than $360 million. This is higher-margin revenue. Apple with the services, this is like Axon services. It's higher-margin revenue is growing very quickly. Finally, i mean, this is just a business too. They continue to invest heavily in research and development to the tune of around 20 percent of total revenue every year, makes a lot of sense to me. They understand our market leading position. They are investing in that dominance and, I expect their performance to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Gardner: Well, thank you for that, Jason, and this is a company, I'm so glad that you brought it to Augmented Reality. Motley Fool members and certainly for Rule Breaker members over the years this has been a stellar performer. In fact, all of these companies well predate for Motley Fool members in their portfolios, the pick that I made two years ago on this five-stock sampler. Basically every stock ever pick for a five-stock sampler, we picked before then somewhere in one of our services, often at much lower cost bases like Apple. But that's irrelevant to the five-stock samplers and to listeners who are following these, because all that really matters is what happened from that point forward. From that 0.2 years ago this week forward, again, Axon, the star performer in this sampler up 53 percent, the market up one percent, take it all-in-all. After two of the three years of five stocks to teach Rule Breakers journey, they're up 4.8 percent on average, the market up now 1.0 percent as we speak. Happy to say 3.8 percent on average, beating the market largely on the strength of just Axon and Apple, the other three underwater, but we'll see a year from now. Jason, you want to hang out with me a year from now this week.\n",

I like to see that a little bit higher, but clearly it was an earnings report that on the expectations front, I think they exceeded some expectations of worsening iPhone sales. iPhone sales were up 1.5% to 51.3 billion, a Q2 record and ahead of some of the estimates, and that was the big concern. Now you have the iPhone that's so meaningful to Apple's business. Even though sales overall were down 3%, there were a lot of currency impacts there. The real growth angle here, Chris and Ron, were the emerging markets and you got a sense of that because Tim Cook has been talking more about that, the CEO of Apple, traveling over to India and the impact of what India soon to be, if not now the most populous country in the world. They've opened up two stores in India now. The emerging market growth is really impressive across the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Mexico, UAE, Turkey. China was actually down, so we're still seeing some impacts from the China come through. Mac and iPad met expectations, but really tough comps with last year. Those weren't very impressive. Services continues to be the other side of the coin with iPhone, up 5.5% to 21 billion, another all-time record, and that was on top of 17% growth a year ago. Wearables was about flat at about 8.8 billion on the sales side, 975 million paid subscribers now to services. That is just really impressive when you think about the ecosystem that Apple is building. Apple Pay later they launch, launch shop with video. The high-yield savings account partnership with Goldman Sachs, they said was really incredible. Global manufacturing now supporting 13 gigawatts of renewable energy. Gross margin was up 130 basis points. That was pretty impressive. Even though product gross margin was down a little bit.

Are you going to pay 27 times because that's what you've got to pay right now? Now, I'm not selling, so that means I'm willing to pay 27 times. I'm not probably willing to pay 30, 33, 35 times. I want to see some growth, Apple putting up some growth numbers.\n",

They represent, I think somewhere around 7% of the S&P 500 of that index and they have a big impact on the dollar too because it's price-weighted. You see the impact this large company with this quarter. Also just a flight to safety I think is also impacting there. You see it with Apple, you see with Microsoft when you're going for quality. Even though people are saying, hey, I'll pay 20 times earnings for that business. That is one of the most respected businesses in the world.\n",

      "\n",
      "Apple has more than doubled its dividend per share over the last decade, and, quite often, long-term investors' highest-yielding stocks are not those bought with a high yield to start with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's earnings and free cash flow (FCF) could easily support a higher payout, and as companies mature, they tend to focus more on dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The graph below shows those first two points. It's not hard to see that Apple's dividend, although rising at a compound annual rate of 8.6% over the last decade, is still very well-covered by earnings and FCF. As such, there's plenty of potential to increase cash dividends paid to investors.\n",

As Hughes writes, GitLab is “one of the leading AI-powered DevSecOps platform” which will give it many opportunities to increase revenue and market share. If you’re looking for something a little safer, Hughes explains why Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has a dividend yield of over 7%, but the stock is far from a yield trap and, in fact, may be too good to pass up. And as many investors may be hitting the road this summer, it’s a good time to check in on a company like Thor Industries, Inc. (NYSE: THO). The company just delivered an earnings report that showed that the floor for RV sales may be higher than analysts expected. Hughes advises investors may want to wait a bit before taking THO stock on a drive, but it does pay a safe dividend if you’re looking for a safe stock for the summer.\n",

I mean do they have Apple-level pricing power or is it more like Chipotle where at some point the Chipotle burrito's not worth it now, can they hike the prices? Yes. Will I pay up for Chipotle?

      "\n",
      "I think No. 1, this is very impressive technology. You have to acknowledge the fact, this is just really impressive technology. I think that in regard to Apple's headset, the use of mixed reality is an important distinction versus other main competitors. I think incorporating augmented and virtual reality into an experience as opposed to it just being straight-up virtual reality, where you're living in this digital virtual world, probably gives it more utility. Now I think we have to discover what that utility is, and we will, in time. I think ultimately, this really does further validate the space that Apple is finally throwing its hat in the ring. They have a reputation for doing that. Letting their competition figure out the space, what works, and what doesn't. Then Apple just works its way in there in its own little fashion, and really comes up with something a little bit differentiated. I think that's what we have here with the VisionPro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with that said, I think it is worth tempering expectations. This is the first shot at this. This is them getting the ball rolling. This is not a mass-consumer device at $3,500. Apple fanboys are going to probably go out there and buy it, but those are few and far between. I think this is something where they'll bring a lot of developers in. They'll build services and experiences with this device to try to figure out its primary utility. It will change in time, but I think this is a really impressive first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Argersinger: It is. It's an impressive first shot. I think we all agree that it's probably going to have to evolve to something closer to what I'm wearing on my face right now versus what I wear when I go skiing. I just don't think people are going to walk around or even sit in their homes for long periods of time, wearing somewhat heavy goggles and a battery pack in their pocket, but it's a good first shot. From a platform perspective though, I think if you build it, especially if you're Apple, the developers will come. I think people a lot smarter than me, including a site like TechCrunch, which has tested the product, they say it's nothing less than a genuine leapfrog in the capability and execution of mixed reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Apple solved a lot of those latency issues, the isolation challenges that previous headsets have had. The resolution is supposed to be incredible, so you can actually read text using the device. The eye-tracking and hand gestures are near perfect, apparently, and you don't have to manually adjust or keep your hands out in front of you, which I think is a limitation of a lot of existing headsets. I think it's still a solution looking for a problem. And I think in this case, it's looking for that killer app, as all these headsets are.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think Apple more than any company, because of the sheer quality, the hardware, and the leaps they've made, probably can find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dylan Lewis: We have used \"virtual reality,\" \"augmented reality,\" as terms in this discussion. I think Apple may prefer that we use \"spatial computing.\" Because that's the term that they continue to come back to, and it seems to be the company's focus. I understand their distinction there, because if you look at what they're offering with this product and what I think the main comparison out there in the market is, with Meta's Quest product, they're a little different in terms of how immersive this is, Jason, and it seems like a slightly different approach to the way that we may interact with some of these virtual elements more layered on our world rather than being something that you are totally immersed in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to the consumer, I think that's where it takes a little bit more time. I'm not saying it won't happen. I just think it's going to take a while to ultimately get to wherever this is taking us. Changing consumer behavior is very difficult unless you have a really compelling use case. And that goes back to Matt's point on the killer app. We hear this, people saying this is the iPhone moment. I don't like that. I just think, let's talk about this as the smartphone moment because Apple doesn't own the smartphone -- iPhone, Android, whatever it may be. But when you see the smartphone, to me that was a fairly obvious one, because we already knew at the time how necessary a phone was. We all knew then, you need a phone, and we also knew how powerful the Internet was at the time. Now you're telling me you're going to Reese's Peanut Butter Cup these things and put the Internet and the phone together. I'm in! It made a lot of sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Argersinger: I love that: spatial computing. It feels like Apple's pushing something out there, saying \"No, this is what it is.\" It's like when Steve Jobs was like, \"Look, I know what customers need. I will build that. They don't know what they don't want.\" I think that's with Apple's approach. I like it.\n",

      "Dylan Lewis: I want to bring it back to Meta one more time before we wind up moving over to another topic here. I think I can't help but wonder with Meta and Apple now entering this space: Is this something that helps broader metaverse ambitions, which Meta would benefit from, Jason, or is this something where Apple is coming in and saying, \"This is our market now\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: Well, I don't think Apple is saying this is our market, because it is very difficult to really fully understand what that market is yet. And the metaverse is a big word, and I know Mark Zuckerberg loves to throw that word around a lot. Again, we're still trying to figure out what, ultimately, is the metaverse for? Why do I need it? Maybe it's fun, maybe it's entertaining, but is it something that I need to interact with every day? Looking at the opportunity, Meta has done very well with its Oculus devices to date. They've sold around 20 million or so. That's not chump change. When you think about the fact that the forecasts out there have Apple maybe selling 150,000 of these devices in the first year, you can see clearly that is meaningless to their financials. You see it doesn't matter. But look at it in the broader context of what Apple does so well, among other things, and their hardware is obviously very strong, but they're closing in on 1 billion paid subscriptions along the way. Now, that is very, very important here, and it's something they do very, very well. That paid subscription number continues to grow. You remember we talked about with Amazon, Jeff Bezos always talking about, \"We don't want to make money from you buying our devices, we want to make money from you using our devices.\" And that's great, because user behavior you do it over and over again. Apple's kind of a \"We want to make money from you buying the device, and we want to make money from you using the device.\" I think that as an investor, I'm on board with that.\n",

Two growth stocks that have the attention of Wall Street following solid financial results in the last quarter are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Global-E Online (NASDAQ: GLBE). Here's why these stocks should be excellent investments for the next decade.\n",

      "\n",
      "Share prices of Apple surged to a new all-time high recently and are trading up about 40% year to date. The gains follow strong iPhone sales, which generate about half of its annual revenue. Apple's biggest seller set a new sales record for the March quarter following the launch of iPhone 14 in the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apple's overall revenue was down 3% year over year, mostly related to lower Mac and iPad sales, the company continues to invest in the long term. Apple's growing portfolio of devices makes it a strong business, as the entire base of active devices continues to hit new records, crossing 2 billion in the last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple just unveiled the Vision Pro virtual reality headset. It won't officially release until next year, and analysts have low expectations for sales in its first year. It's expensive and may be lacking a killer app to win mass consumer appeal at launch, but it's a long-term bet that can spark more opportunities to grow the installed base of devices, which tends to drive more sales of apps and subscriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason to like Apple is the tremendous amount of cash flow the business produces from revenue. The company generated a whopping $97 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. It can afford to spend billions developing new products and services while rewarding shareholders with growing dividends and share buybacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has the brand and cash-generating ability to be around for decades. iPhone continues to remain strong because it has turned into an essential everyday device that people keep with them at all times. That's a great business to tuck away in your retirement nest egg.\n",

      "Tim White: If you think about the Apple I, maybe that's where the innovators were, people who were willing to take a risk on it at the time, an inflation-adjusted $5,000 or $6,000 on a computer that basically did nothing. You had to make it do anything you wanted to make it do. It really led to a lot of people at the time in that trough of disillusionment that happened with personal computers of like, no one will ever need a PC in their homes, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm wondering if we think about this, there are different types of technologies that we've seen cross the chasm. Yesterday, when we were prepping for this, we talked a little bit about home computers, which really were, I mean, I know we've been at this for 30 years. When we were kids, home computers were, I mean, boy, it was a privilege to have one. I think you said, I felt the same way. We got our Apple IIe from my uncle, who was a very early adopter of computing, and I mean, it was unusual in the early 1980s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim White: Yeah. I think if you think about the Apple I, maybe that's where the innovators were, people who were willing to take a risk on it at the time, an inflation-adjusted $5,000 or $6,000 on a computer that basically did nothing. [laughs] You have to make it do anything you wanted to make it do. It really led to a lot of people at the time in that trough of disillusionment that happened with personal computers of like, no one will ever need a PC in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the early adopters, people like your uncle, my father, who bought an Apple II plus, were like, we need to have our children have a chance to use this because these computers will be the future. That was a huge privilege to be able to have a computer like that in my home. Of course, I immediately grabbed onto it and then really never let go.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those early adopters are what give companies enough money and enough feedback. This is the beautiful thing about a first-version product is you get feedback from your customers, and then you can make your product better and better. That's where the Apple IIe, like you talked about, suddenly hit the education market and really exploded and took off and really made Apple up until the Macintosh came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Beyers: Apple, in some ways, found its way at least into the chasm and started bridging across through things that made that computer or the computers that Apple was making a lot more useful for solving a business problem. I'll use the example of one of the great early apps that made Apple's machines incredibly useful for the business community. I mean, I know you know this one, but there's a lot of people who've probably have never heard of VisiCalc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim White: I think it does because either expectations can be very low. If you're spending $3,000 on something unless you're a super early adopter. I'm looking at Apple Vision Pro. [laughs] Unless you're a super-early adopter, spending that kind of money, you have very high expectations that this is going to be a product that's going to solve some problems for you. Whether that problem be boredom, [laughs] entertainment, whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try this again. There's a lot of people competing on this right now, which definitely leads to tech going very fast in terms of how well it gets better, but will that be really useful to a lot of people in their daily life soon? I don't know. Apple was very careful not to say \"AI\" in their big announcements, and I think that's telling that they don't think it's there yet.\n",

      "Ricky Mulvey: Yesterday, Apple presented the Vision Pro, an augmented reality headset and its first major new product since 2014. It's going to sell for about $3,500 and is available early next year. Huge products launched yesterday. What was your reaction to the overall presentation and even the price point?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nick Sciple: The product launch, unlike other maybe big Apple reveals previously, was very much telegraphed. You could have opened up any big business publication yesterday and said, \"Hey Apple's revealing a new product,\" which is maybe a little different than some of the reveals in the past. However, you look at the hardware, certainly interesting as Apple always immediately stands out. No hand controllers for this augmented reality device, very different than what you're getting with the Oculus or some others on the market, really have to have some sophisticated 3D sensing technology to be able to make that take place, to be able to see what your hands are doing and all types of lighting from all types of angles and seems they have released with sophisticated technology there. The other thing that stood out to me, it does have a battery pack that attaches via cord, and a lot of people talked about that, looks a little bit awkward, not maybe as sleek as you might expect from an Apple product, but clearly the company focused on the weight of the device. If you think about the Oculus is out there, sometimes the battery gets pretty heavy. All that weight on your head can maybe weigh on some of the extended wear issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "That maybe explains the reasoning behind that. But the presentation, I think overall, was very interesting as well. Unlike the big competitor, Meta, which has changed the company of their name to get behind the metaverse hype. You didn't see Apple mentioned metaverse or AI really a single time. In their presentation, they talked about machine learning, about spatial computing. Really bring to it to the forth a new type of computing that we haven't seen before, focusing on the augmented reality side of things. Things like, we're going to project your eyes onto this device externally so that other folks that are in the room not participating in the experience know what's going on. Definitely a different focus to Apple, more about augmented reality that than some of these other folks. Certainly, the price point stands out. You're looking at a few hundred dollars for the competing Meta device, Apple coming out at $3,500. Very expensive, but I think that reflects some of the hardware under the hood. They've got the M2 chip, which they use in a number of their MacBook devices. This is a computer-quality chip. Along with that their R1 chip that's really going to be doing a lot of the sensing. Really some hefty hardware there, which maybe reflects the price point. Could other competitors replicate this at a similar price point? I don't know, but Apple has certainly delivered a top-of-the-line device, which reflects their brand and where they position themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ricky Mulvey: The trade-offs are absolutely noticeable, and there's a lot of talk about whether or not this is a smart idea for Apple to launch this at this time. My personal feeling is I wouldn't bet on Tim Cook doing something stupid. But the trade-offs are very noticeable. You have the battery pack and the device itself, only lasts for about two hours. But Apple also put a 4K television on something the size of a postage stamp. I would not bet against their engineers to figure this out in the future. Some of the use cases are really interesting to me, Nick, you have watching movies where it's going to basically be able to expand the screen to cinema size, videoconferencing, FaceTime where it's going to scan your face. When your friends and family are communicating with you and seeing a 3D rendering. It doesn't look like you're wearing snowboard goggles. Any of the use cases you want to focus in on?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nick Sciple: Well, I think the one thing that really stood out to me was the, I don't know if it's the home movie experience, so that's the way to describe it, but it's going to feature Apple's first 3D camera, which is going to let you really have a massive experience. You think about, every Sunday I have a FaceTime call with my parents, I have a young child and my parents live a long way away. FaceTime really opens up a new dynamic of interacting with folks. You can tell a story about how this technology with some of these 3D home movie experience is really opening a new dynamic of interaction from long distances away. Whether it's families here in the U.S. that the children have moved away or folks that have moved across the world. I think that'll be an interesting application, and I find that a lot more exciting for your everyday consumer, more so than some of these really niche gaming experiences that you've heard sold with other products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nick Sciple: If you think about when the iPhone launched really opened a whole new medium of communication, the whole selfie video, YouTube, a lot of those things, has really been opened up by what the iPhone allowed. You could tell a story about where this technology opens up a new market, I think to get that type of impact though on the market. You need to see the product widely distributed in a way that the iPhone has become today. If you think about when that product first came out. I remember my parents telling me, why the heck would you need a whole bunch of apps on your phone? Why would you need internet access and why would you want to pay the price point to that product? You could see a similar experience, here I will say one challenge with getting that distribution for this virtual reality device as compared with the iPhone is you're not going to have companies like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile subsidizing the purchase of this device in order to attach a wireless plan. Apple really having to sell this device on its own merits without support from third parties, which I think getting to that distribution you see with the smartphone much harder. But certainly, an interesting innovation in this virtual reality headset world, a different approach relative to some of the other folks. Apple has a reputation to support, they've certainly taken a good first step into the space.\n",

      "Ricky Mulvey: Let's move on to Coinbase, because while Apple stock did not react to the presentation of these new goggles. Coinbase fell 15% this morning after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it is suing the company for operating as an unregistered securities exchange and failing to register its staking-as-a-service program.

      "Fast-forward to 2009, and Apple stock was trading at a split-adjusted price of just $2.79 per share, down more than 60% from its high.

It isn’t hard to see why it should be a success, generating excitement that goes beyond the usual level of buzz that accompanies an upcoming phone launch. I have no inside information or anything, but I feel confident in predicting that the phrase “AI” will play a prominent role in the hype around the 15.\n",

      "Now, it may or may not be that AI technology is in some way incorporated into the phone or is relevant to how it operates and what it offers, but that won’t be the point. By now, everyone has heard of AI, and everyone wants a part of it, so there will be lot of FOMO around when the new product becomes available.

      "\n",
      "Ricky Mulvey: Apple has entered the battle for your deposits. Jason Moser and Matt Frankel take a look at the tech giant's offering and check in on regional banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you mentioned something there that I want to dig into a little bit more. You mentioned a phrase, \"nonbank instruments,\" and that makes me think of Apple. And Apple now, they're rolling out a banking relationship or a banking product, a savings account, I think it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's interesting. Apple is not a bank. It's the home of those same types of regulatory constraints that banks typically are, but they partner with banks, I think maybe in this case it's Goldman Sachs. Is the Apple bank a threat, do you think, to regional banks? Are they feeling pressure from this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: Like you said, Apple is not a bank. They have no desire to be a bank. There's a lot of regulatory headaches that come with that. They don't want to be a bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw a lot of early traction from the Apple savings account. It pays a 4.15% APY, which is pretty good. In the first four days of its debut, which happened in April -- which was right after the big banking panics; take that for what you will -- it attracted about a billion dollars' worth of deposits in four days. That had people thinking, is this going to destroy the banking system as we know it? Doesn't every other person in the world use Apple? Between me and you and the two people behind the glass, I'm sure at least two of us have an iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's understandable why people would think that that could be a big disruptor, but there are a few things to keep in mind. No. 1, that APY makes them competitive with other online-based banks, not dominant. I'm a SoFi customer, for example, and mine pays 4.3% right now, so better than the Apple savings account. It's not the highest rate you're going to get out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rollout has not been without its speed bumps. If you Google \"Apple savings account,\" all the news stories that come up are how people can't get their money in a timely manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third reason that I'm not too worried about Apple is other fintechs have a lot more to offer in the financial context. Apple's a big ecosystem, but the savings is like an adjacent product. It makes sense because that's where people's Apple Card rewards points are being deposited into. That's where the cash back goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: I mentioned SoFi. The reason I use SoFi, it's not just because they have a good APY. I can get that in other places. It's because I can also have my investment account in that same place. I can also get a mortgage from them if I want to. I can also finance my car. I can also do a student loan refinance. I can also have a credit card through them. I can have a big banking relationship with a lot of these other fintechs that you can't with Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it's a niche product. It serves a purpose well. The Apple credit card, it's a nice user base, it's desirable, but I don't think it's going to be a serious bank disruptor. There's something like $14 trillion of deposit volume in the last month in the U.S. banking system. That $1 billion might sound like a big amount of money, but in the scheme of things, it's really not that big in banking. So I don't worry about Apple really being a big competitor to the rest of the banking system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: Well, in regard to the regional banks, it does sound like, I mean, at least Apple, isn't necessarily the threat that maybe some thought it could have been. But when you're putting those regional banks up against the big banks and looking at the evolution of this industry, it seems like we're seeing more consolidation, and that likely will continue. Do you view regional bank stocks is a good investment today?\n",

Apple is very methodical on the way they move into markets like these, and we knew this was going to be a very slow process even if everything went according to plan. Clearly, they're going to be some delays here, tech supply issues or some problems with the displays there. What I think is more fascinating and we've been talking a lot about this and the cost of this device. We're already talking about the cheaper version. When does it come. They're already saying, they're working on a cheaper version that's two years out. It goes back to, I think, this expensive first device. This is really to set the tone, help developers build experiences that make this device relevant and ultimately attractive to consumers. The one they start rolling out, there is more affordable devices, it's a little bit of an easier sale.\n",

      "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) faced some mixed sentiment from investors in 2023 as its top and bottom lines decelerated slightly amid ongoing economic volatility and fluctuating consumer spending. Still, the stock is trading up 46% from the start of this year as it has continued to report a record installed base of devices, generous profits, and impressive results from its rapidly growing services segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at Apple's results for the first half of its fiscal 2023 (ended April 1), the company generated total net sales of $212 billion on net income of $54 billion. Of that net-sales total, $117 billion was derived from iPhone sales. In short, smartphones -- a space in which Apple retains aglobal marketshare of around 21% -- still account for more than half of Apple's top line.\n",

      "Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Motley Fool Contributor, Matt Frankel. He caught up with Jason Moser to talk about the boom in immersive technology. They discuss how Apple's Vision Pro stands out from Meta's Quest headset, the consumer and industrial use cases for immersive tech, and three less obvious companies that could benefit from this trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: Matt, this week we're jumping into the wide world of immersive technology. We've got virtual reality, augmented reality, there's mixed reality. These are all certainly becoming more popular conversations these days. Today we want to cover the latest in Apple's headset aspirations. We'll also talk about Meta's latest subscription offering, and we're also going to talk about some alternative ways to invest in this new computing paradigm beyond the obvious names. But Matt, let's get started here with Apple because this is the big news. Recently Apple releasing its new headset; the Vision Pro. This is something that we've been waiting for for a long time. Always rumors out there that they were going to be releasing something at some point now we finally actually got it. Matt, it's a great look in a piece of hardware. I'm still not fully sold on mass adoption for something like this, particularly at that price tag. What do you think?\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: I think it's historically been a mistake to underestimate Apple fans' willingness to spend money. [laughs]\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: How many people said the iPhone was too expensive when it first came out? At the time, you could walk into any AT&T or Verizon store and walk out with a free phone if you signed a contract, not so with the iPhone but people still bought it because it was a superior product. All the early reviews say that with the Vision Pro, you get what you pay for. I did see that they're cutting targets on production. The original goal was about a million units in the first year then they slashed that, I think 400,000. Now we're hearing that some suppliers are only planning on about 150,000 in the first year. I'm not sure that I buy it. I think the adoption is going to be greater than we think. I think the million might actually be a relatively conservative target given Apple, there are over two billion active Apple devices throughout the world. You need 0.1% of their customer base to adapt this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: I do fully agree with you on that notion that you should never really underestimate what Apple fans will do. I have always said they can stamp their logo on a rock and just sell three million of them immediately no questions asked because people would just view it as a special rock for some reason. The power of that brand. I'm really not kidding. I really believe they could do that. So you're welcome, Tim Cook if you're looking for a new product line. But yeah, it is one of those things. When you look at this versus something like formerly Oculus, but the Meta's Quest line, the pricing is what really stands out to me and I think we'd all agree that the Vision Pro of today isn't going to be the Vision Pro of 10 years from now or even five years. This is their first step. This is their playbook. Let others get out there, test the waters, and bring new hardware, new concepts that they're figuring out what works and what doesn't work. Then Apple jumps in there with its own interpretation of that hardware, of that software in making it do what they think is most valuable. I don't think this is any different, honestly. It's not like headsets are that new. Meta has been at this for a while with Oculus. There are a lot of early adopters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price points for those Metal headsets are considerably lower. You're talking about something in that $500-1,000 range for a Quest headset, generally speaking, versus that initial $3,500 price tag for Vision Pro. That's going to be considerably different. Now the one thing I do think in regard to this very first iteration of the Vision Pro. I don't think this is meant for the mass consumer. I think this is that tool that gets out there and really helps Apple build this spatial computing ecosystem. That's where it's going to take some time to develop, of course, but it can really pay off because to your point there on devices, Apple is also closing in on one billion subscriptions, and that is just extremely powerful. Oftentimes subscriptions that people aren't even thinking about. They're just set on rebuild every month and Apple's got such an audience, they really are very loyal to the brand and its offerings. Again, while they are slashing that guidance for the initial offerings though there's some tech supply issues and other some problem with the displays. But they are working on cheaper versions of this hardware that's still a couple of years out at least, but they are already thinking in that direction of, hey, if we want to get mass consumer adoption here, we are going to need to bring that price tag down. I have no doubt that happens. I think the bigger question really is the use case. What do you find the real use case to be with something like a Vision Pro or even just headsets in general?\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: It feels like what they're trying to do is different than what Meta is trying to do. For Meta it's like a gaming product. It's not a computer replacement. Apple is trying to do a replacement for a laptop, for a TV. They're talking about the potential for 3D movies and things like that. Instead of your TV, instead of your laptop, if it can effectively replace those two things, 3,500 doesn't sound that ridiculous. You mentioned that they are planning a cheaper version two years from now. With Meta, Meta sold about 20 million of its headsets. The overwhelming majority is that lower-price Quest 2 headset their second iteration, which I can see the same thing being true for Apple. But they've sold 20 million headsets without an existing hardware ecosystem that Apple already has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: Apple has that advantage. Apple is not going to sell 20 million of the initial version of it. But there's a lot of demand for this and especially if the functionality justifies the price tag, which the initial reports are that it does to some degree. It supposedly leaps and downs beyond even the Quest Pro from Meta in terms of just the technology. We'll see how it plays out. But I believe I remember you being an iPhone user are you on the waiting list for this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: No question. You take it to the next step. You talk about wearing these things outside of the home in overlaying the digital on top of the physical to bring more use cases into your everyday life. Driving, for example. We've got companies that are building windshields that incorporate this augmented reality technology, sands headset. You don't need a headset to use these windshields. That's what makes me wonder regarding these headsets. We've already got companies that are building out this technology and overlaying the digital on top of the physical without necessarily having to incorporate a headset into the mix. It does make me wonder, but again, I do listen, I know the form factor is going to come down. I know the size is going to become less and less of an issue as time goes on. I think that's going to be a big piece to the puzzle where that should help not only Apple but all headset makers. Speaking of all headset makers, I wanted to talk about Meta for a second here too. You mentioned I think earlier just regarding the Quest, the Quest serves a gaming population primarily. I think that's right for the most part. Meta, really leading into that they launched a VR subscription service with their Quest line to really capitalize on that population. This is a service, $7.99 a month. It's something that looks like it is catering specifically to that gaming audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: That's what Apple is trying to do. If there's one thing Apple's good at, I mentioned their customers will spend money, but Apple's really good at justifying the cost. They're very good at it. Their ecosystem pairs really well together. People are willing to spend money, pay a premium for the Apple Watch, for example, because it pairs so well with everything else Apple. If they can accomplish that with the Apple headset the Vision Pro, then great. I think that that's where they're trying to go to move beyond just gaming applications, like I mentioned, to be a laptop replacement. Instead of buying four monitors, if I could just look and see four monitors in the air in my room, that could justify a $3,500 price tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Frankel: If they could replace having a projector and a projection screen on my wall to watch movies, it could justify that price tag. That's an ambitious price. This is not the first ambitious price that has come from Apple. I think if it's anything like other product launches, they could do a good job at justifying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: I think ultimately what they're going to do here is what they do so well, getting that first iteration out there and just learning, discovering the use cases, what they're doing well, where they need to shore things up. This is a company with more resources than most countries on the face of this Earth. [laughs] I certainly do not doubt they will give it their all. I like your statement at the top of the show. You just cannot underestimate. You cannot underestimate Apple. They're so talented in what they do and they always seem to figure out a way and the brand power, they're a very loyal user base indeed. To be continued. We'll certainly enjoy following along the progress here and revisiting down the line. Matt, before we wrap it up here, we wanted to talk a little bit about just some alternative ways for folks to consider getting exposure to the immersive technology space. Because we talk so much about these big tech companies, the hardware, the headsets. These are the obvious players in this space because we talk about them so much. They're always in the headlines. But there are a lot of other ways to really invest in immersive technology. There are companies that'll help powering these headsets. There companies that are capitalizing on the software, incorporating these types of experiences into their business models. We wanted to just throw a few extra ideas out there. I know you have one. I'll kick us off here with one and then go to you.\n",

It lost that market to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, which rendered its keyboard devices obsolete with a new generation of touchscreen phones. Instead, it's now a company that generates most of its revenue from cybersecurity software, Internet of Things (IoT) software, and patent licensing fees.\n",

      "BlackBerry lost the mobile market to Apple and Google for three simple reasons.

Back in 2010, BlackBerry only offered about 2,500 apps, compared to 250,000 apps on the App Store and 100,000 apps on Google Play. Therefore, developers were less likely to develop new BlackBerry apps for that tiny market, which caused fewer people to buy BlackBerry devices because they lacked the latest apps.\n",

      "July 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court judge criticized Apple AAPL.O on Monday over legal arguments it made as it prepares to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a ruling that could require the iPhone maker to change payment practices in its App Store.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an order, Judge Milan Smith of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Apple had made statements in its bid for time to appeal to the Supreme Court that \"may not be technically frivolous\" but that ignore the factual record and rulings in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, despite the criticism of Apple's legal arguments, Smith and two other judges gave Apple 90 days to file a petition with the justices and paused its ruling on payment through apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple plans to fight an injunction — which the 9th Circuit upheld in April — that says it can't ban links within apps available through Apple's App store that direct consumers to payment options outside of the App Store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such links and buttons would give developers a chance to bypass paying 30% sales commissions to Apple. \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games in 2020 sued Apple over its commissions, accusing Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When our reasoning and the district court's findings are considered, Apple's arguments cannot withstand even the slightest scrutiny,\" Smith wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Apple spokesperson and lawyers for the company involved in the case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's lawyers had asked the 9th Circuit to pause issuing the court's formal \"mandate.\" The court's mandate would have imposed the injunction that Apple wants the Supreme Court to scrap. Epic Games opposed Apple's bid to delay the court's mandate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its filing, Apple questioned Epic's legal \"standing\" to bring the antitrust suit in the first place. Apple also challenged the scope of the 9th Circuit's injunction, saying it should apply only to Epic and its subsidiaries and not nationally to all developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Apple's argument \"overlooks aspects of the panel opinion's analysis that are inconvenient to its position,\" Smith wrote. Epic's role as a games distributor, Smith said, justified a broad-reaching injunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple seemed to make arguments that \"challenge an imagined panel opinion on an imagined record,\" Smith wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Epic chief executive Tim Sweeney in a tweet on Monday expressed disappointment that the injunction against Apple would remain paused for now. He said the 9th Circuit's order was \"justice delayed, again.\"\n",

      "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made a lot of headlines this year after unveiling its highly anticipated virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset and becoming the first company to achieve a market cap of $3 trillion. As a result, the tech giant is probably on your radar for potential investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Apple's dominance suggests it could benefit most in the future from technological advances, especially from the consumer-focused side of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why Apple's stock is a screaming long-term buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes have been on artificial intelligence (AI) this year, with the market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. As a result, companies that are very publicly focused on developing the sector, like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, have rallied investors. However, Apple could play a crucial role in the future of AI, even if it isn't super vocal about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike many of its peers, Apple seems strategically intent on avoiding the term AI. While other companies are heavily using the phrase to garner investor support, the iPhone company is instead focused on debuting new software features that are quietly enabled by AI. In doing so, Apple is protecting its brand by making it harder to lump its business in with the other big names in AI and avoid comparisons. This strategy can reduce volatility in Apple's stock, as it won't be harshly affected by fluctuations in the AI market.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the dominance of its products means it will likely be the main driver of AI adoption by the public. At Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June, it unveiled several new AI-run software features. Improvements to the iPhone's autocorrect use a transformer language model, the same technology that led to OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, while other companies utilize massive server farms to run similar AI workloads, Apple impressively gets the job done directly on the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to its smartphone, the company has brought AI upgrades to the AirPod Pros, which can automatically turn off noise canceling when the user is in a conversation. As Apple continues to develop alongside AI, other products in its lineup will likely get upgrades, which could bolster consumer interest and revenue over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is an unstoppable force in consumer tech\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, Samsung's smartphone market share in the U.S. stagnated at 27% for the quarter. Meanwhile, Motorola's decreased from 10% to 8%. However, the iPhone's massive dominance in the sector allowed it to take advantage of poor market conditions, with Apple's market share rising from 49% to 53% in Q1 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a similar phenomenon occurred in the personal computing industry. According to IDC, PC shipments tumbled 13% in Q2 2023, with companies like Lenovo and Dell experiencing declines of 18% and 22%. However, the same period saw Apple enjoy the only rise in PC shipments among its biggest competitors, with Mac shipments up 10% year over year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tech stock has proven its resilience amid uncertain market conditions and consumers' preferences for its products. This means that alongside a promising future in AI and a stock that has risen roughly 300% in the last five years, Apple is a no-brainer buy right now.\n",

      "When investing in dividend stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two prominent names that often come up for consideration. Both companies have a long history of generating significant returns for their shareholders. Even more, each company has been able to pay a steadily growing dividend to investors over the last decade while also delivering market-beating returns in their share prices. But which tech giant's shares are the more attractive bet for investors looking for a reliable stream of growing income?\n",
      "\n",
      "To decide whether Apple or Microsoft is a better dividend stock, let's compare the two companies on three key factors dividend investors should consider when buying a stock for its income stream: dividend history, payout ratio, and valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though both Apple and Microsoft boast impressive dividend history, Microsoft has Apple beat on this front. The company has paid a dividend every year since 2003 and has rewarded investors with annual increases to its dividend for 11 consecutive years. Apple has similarly delivered 11 years of consecutive increases, but its current streak of dividend payments only started in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft is also notably growing its dividend at a faster rate than Apple. The company's most recent increase was 10% per share. This put the quarterly dividend at $0.68, or $2.72 annually. As of this writing, this dividend payout gives Microsoft a dividend yield of about 0.8%. Apple's last dividend increase came in at 4.3%. The current payout puts Apple's dividend yield at 0.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle between Microsoft and Apple as dividend stocks heats up when you consider the two companies' payout ratios, or the percentage of their earnings they are currently paying out in dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's payout ratio is extremely low, at just 16%. This suggests the company has huge room to continue growing its dividend over time -- even if earnings fail to grow or even contract. Microsoft's payout ratio is still low, albeit not as low as Apple's. The software specialist's payout ratio is 28%, leaving plenty of breathing room for the quarterly cash payout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming in with the tiebreaker is Apple's more conservative valuation. The stock trades at 33 times earnings, while Microsoft trades at about 38 times earnings. While analysts do notably expect more rapid earnings growth from Microsoft over the next five years than Apple, Microsoft's valuation is high enough that it seems to be pricing in all of the company's expected long-term growth. On the other hand, Apple's more conservative valuation leaves a little more room for the tech company to potentially surprise to the upside regarding earnings growth over the next five to 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all this said, Microsoft may be the better bet for investors prioritizing dividend yield today. Of course, both companies have quite low dividend yields. So, if a substantial dividend yield is a priority, investors may want to consider different ideas altogether. But for the patient investor who does need a large stream of cash today but still wants to own a solid long-term dividend stock, Apple is a decent idea.\n",

      "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It is considered one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Its hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, the AirPods wireless earbuds, the AirPods Max headphones, and the HomePod smart speaker line.

Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple I and Apple II, grew quickly.\n",

According to Martin, one of the leading contenders to buy the house that Walt built is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world’s largest company. An Apple and Disney merger would certainly create significant investor interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no question that Apple could afford to buy Disney.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big question is whether Apple CEO Tim Cook would be interested in such a big acquisition. As far as I know, Apple’s largest acquisition was Beats Electronics. It paid $3 billion in 2014 for the headphones and speakers manufacturer. The next largest by dollar value was Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) smartphone modem business in 2019. The iPhone maker paid approximately $1 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Apple hadn’t borrowed so much in recent years to buy back its stock — Apple’s long-term debt as of April 1 was $97.0 billion compared to $0 as of Sept. 29, 2012 — the decision would be much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with Martin’s assessment that Apple makes sense as a suitable buyer. Here are three reasons why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple Has More Money Than God\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Cook became CEO of Apple in August 2011 after Steve Jobs became too ill to run the company. Jobs died two months later. The CEO received $376 million in stock awards for his new pay package. That’s a massive amount, yet it only accounts for less than 1% of the net debt on its balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, Apple has more money than God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming Apple pays 30-40% more than Disney’s current market cap, that’s $220 billion at the high end of Martin’s estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s long-term debt is 3.2% of its $3.04 trillion market cap. If it were to finance 100% of the purchase price with new debt, that would up the percentage to 10.4%. That’s still very low. By comparison, Warren Bros. Discovery’s (NASDAQ:WBD) long-term debt of $45 billion as of March 31 is 152% of its $29.9 billion market cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Apple’s many different revenue streams, there is no comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even when you add Disney’s $45 billion in long-term debt to Apple’s balance sheet, the debt of $362 billion [$97B (existing debt) plus $220B (purchase price) plus $45B (Disney’s debt)] would be 11.9% of its current market cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creutz also reminded his clients that Disney is searching for a new Chief Financial Officer to replace departed CFO Christine McCarthy, who served for over eight years and worked at Disney for 23 years. This is key to the Apple and Disney merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple Is a Services Business\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as Apple is known for its iPhone, the reality is that it’s become far more services-oriented under Tim Cook. The company’s non-manufacturing revenues accounted for 22.0% of its overall revenue in Q2 2023, 160 basis points higher than a year earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why buying Disney would be a smart move by Cook. This is key to the Apple and Disney merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products division could be leveraged by Apple to an even greater extent than what Disney is currently doing to cross-sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple brings the distribution — 1.25 billion customers — while Disney brings the content.\n",

The iPhone company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) are quite a few points below the same figures for Microsoft, suggesting it is the cheaper option.\n",
      "\n",
      "P/E is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF compares a company's share price to its free cash flow. With both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value. These valuation metrics can be useful to determine whether a stock is trading at a bargain or is overvalued. An optimal P/E and P/FCF would customarily be under 20 to be considered undervalued. As a result, Apple stock may not be a bargain buy, but it is a chapter option when compared to Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it is still early days for the AI market, with Microsoft likely to continue facing steep competition for years to come.

      "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) maintained its dominant position in the world of consumer tech through a fair number of economic cycles. While smartphones remain its top source of revenue and profits, it has consistently demonstrated that the versatility of its business model can lend it resilience in a wide range of market environments. Even though shifting consumer spending patterns have resulted in decelerating growth on its top and bottom lines, Apple still has a rock-solid balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the trailing three-year period, Apple's annual revenue increased by 44%, while its operating income rose by 80%. Meanwhile, it boosted its cash on hand by 51%. In its most recently reported quarter, net sales totaled $95 billion and net income came to $24 billion. Both those figures were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but were up 63% and 115%, respectively, on a three-year basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, smartphones account for a little over half of Apple's net sales, while more than one-fifth is attributable to its services segment, which includes the App Store, as well as a wide variety of subscription-based offerings such as Apple TV+ and Apple Music. It also includes its financial products, like its recently launched \"buy now, pay later\" service and its advertising segment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Where was Apple in 2008 and 2009?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple had a market cap of $175 billion at the beginning of 2008. That figure dropped as low as $70 billion during the year before rising to $190 billion by the end of 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, Apple is worth a lot more today. In fact, it recently became the first $3 trillion company, meaning its market cap has increased more than 15-fold in less than 14 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardware innovation undoubtedly played a role. Apple benefits from immense brand authority and consumer loyalty born of its ability to stay on the cutting edge of consumer electronics. The last 14 years have seen the company launch several new generations of the iPhone, debut the iPad and Apple Watch, and design the M1 and M2 chips. But Apple has also branched into services during that time, a move that unleashed its profitability. Dan Ives said he believes that evolution is responsible for much of its share price appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple surpassed 2 billion active devices this year, and it monetizes that installed based with adjacent services like iCloud storage, Apple Pay, and App Store downloads. The company also provides subscription content like Apple News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Music. Those services generate recurring revenue that earns much higher margins than cyclical hardware sales. Indeed, Apple achieved a gross profit margin of 36.1% in 2008, but that figure has since risen 710 basis points to 43.2% over the trailing 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buying Tesla stock today could be like buying Apple stock in 2009\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla shareholders are unlikely to see 15-fold returns over the next 14 years, but the premise behind Ives' analogy to Apple is still valid: Tesla is currently building its hardware base in preparation for its evolution into AI software and services. So investors who focus on minute margin fluctuations from one quarter to the next may miss the big picture. At some point, assuming all goes smoothly, FSD software sales and robotaxi services could launch Tesla into the stratosphere by opening new revenue streams that earn much higher margins.\n",

More importantly, the company was valued at between 10x and 15x forward-year earnings. This made the United States' leading smartphone provider a phenomenal value.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things have changed drastically in 2023. Apple's iPhone 14 hasn't flown off retail shelves as quickly as expected (first-half fiscal 2023 sales for iPhone are down $5.1 billion from the comparable period last year), and Mac sales are down 30% through the first six months of the current fiscal year.

      "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) have benefited from the broader stock market surge, logging gains of 50% and 95% year to date. More importantly, both stocks seem capable of sustaining their rallies and delivering more upside to investors.\n",

      "1. Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "A $1,000 investment in Apple stock at the end of 2022 is now worth $1,500. There were a few solid reasons to buy shares of Apple at the end of last year, such as the company's growing business and its attractive valuation. For example, Apple stock was trading at 21 times trailing earnings at the end of 2022, and the company was delivering resilient growth despite the slowdown in the smartphone market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is now trading at a relatively expensive 32 times trailing earnings. However, the stock looks like a solid buy even at these levels, since the tech giant could deliver stronger-than-expected growth once it launches its next-generation smartphone lineup. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives upped his price target on Apple stock to $220 from $205 last month, pointing out that the company is on the cusp of a major iPhone upgrade cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Ives, there are around 250 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in more than four years. The launch of this year's iPhone 15 is expected to encourage those users to upgrade to Apple's latest smartphones, and more importantly, bump the company's average selling price (ASP) per unit as well. Given that the company has sold an estimated 224 million iPhones over the past four quarters, the company could enjoy a double-digit bump in volumes over the next year if all those 250 million iPhones are upgraded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Ives points out that the improving mix of the higher-priced Pro and Pro Max models in Apple's smartphone sales should give Apple's iPhone ASP a shot in the arm. According to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), Apple's iPhone ASP reportedly increased to $988 in March 2023 from $882 in the same period a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that a potential increase in the price of the company's next-generation iPhones -- potentially up to $200 as per some analysts -- could push iPhone ASP beyond $1,000. As a result, Apple could enjoy a nice mix of volume and ASP growth once it launches its next series of iPhones. This could help the company outperform Wall Street's growth expectations over the next year and may even help it hit the Street-high price target of $240, which would be a 23% increase from current levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a $1,000 investment in Apple stock could turn out to be a profitable investment thanks to the iPhone catalyst, as well as the other growth drivers that the company is sitting on.\n",

For example, an illiquid stock trading 50,000 shares daily can tank on bad news and be difficult to exit if just a few mid-size investors jump ship. Conversely, a liquid stock like Apple, which trades close to 100 million shares a day on average, can absorb such “tape bombs.” In fact, AAPL has a beta of 1.28, meaning that based on its historical volatility it is only 28% more volatile than the S&P 500 Index.\n",

      "Parkev Tatevosian: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is not often thought of as a dividend stock. Most investors still focus on the growth stock and tech stock aspects of this company. But Apple does pay out a regular dividend and it has more than doubled its per-share payout over the past 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also not likely that dividends are the main reason the stock is such a big part of Buffett and Berkshire's portfolio (roughly 46% of the portfolio is Apple stock). This stock likely attracts Buffett more for its share price appreciation. The passive income from this low-yield stock is more of a cherry on top for Berkshire. Although it is fair to say that the Oracle of Omaha appreciates the passive income Apple stock provides and the fact that it's growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2013 and 2022, Apple's per-share dividend more than doubled, going from $0.41 to $0.90. More importantly, Apple's earnings per share increased by a compounded annual rate of 14.5% in that period. Why is that important? Because earnings are crucial to dividend payments. Without sufficient profits, dividends must be paid from unsustainable sources like savings or debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that Apple has built strong loyalty among consumers over several decades, it's reasonable to assume that it can continue to grow earnings, even at a slower pace than in the previous decade. Additionally, Apple's ecosystem of apps, services, and hardware makes it difficult for customers to switch brands. The savvy investor that he is, Buffett understands the value of customer loyalty.\n",

That said, a diversified portfolio that includes Apple stock has a reasonable chance of increasing your wealth in the long run.\n",

Investors are also excited about prospects for the new iPhone 15 which is scheduled to launch in September. But it’s not just about the iPhones. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng expects Apple to surpass earnings estimates, led by strength in its Mac and Services segments. Ng is expecting Services revenue of $21.8 billion to rise 11% year-over-year, clearing Wall Street forecast of $20.7 billion. “Upside to our Services forecast reflects the inflection in App Store spending, per Sensor Tower, strong growth in advertising, continued content investments in AppleTV, and a more benign forex headwind relative to company guidance of -400 bps,\" Ng wrote in an investor note. The market will also look for details about its long-awaited mixed reality headset, dubbed Vision Pro, which was unveiled at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference.

      "Let's take a closer look at the key product and service introductions that helped drive Apple to its current market capitalization of over $3 trillion, making it the most valuable company on the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple wasn't always the flourishing company that we are all familiar with. In fact, it was actually struggling at the turn of the century, until the introduction of the iPod in 2001 put the business back on the map and made it a force to be reckoned with in the market for consumer electronics. The iPod had a wonderful run, lasting 21 years. Apple discontinued the music player last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the chart above and you'll see Apple's history is full of game-changing hardware products. The iPhone, which some might consider the single greatest innovation in corporate history, is what catapulted the company to become dominant on a global stage. Since 2007, when the first iPhone was launched, Apple has made dozens of upgrades, all with incredible consumer demand. In fiscal 2022, the iPhone represented 52% of overall company revenue, so it remains the core contributor to Apple's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the iPad, Watch, AirPods, and new MacBooks, the innovation engine continues humming along. Apple recently showcased its Vision Pro headset, potentially setting the foundation for making the company a formidable competitor in the AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) markets. There are also rumors swirling that Apple is working on an autonomous vehicle. If these more far-fetched ideas become hits like previous products, then Apple's market cap could be much higher than it is right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Apple has done a wonderful job in recent years of growing its Services segment, which accounted for 20% of company sales last fiscal year. This division offers things like Pay, TV+, Music, and iCloud. The high-margin recurring revenue it produces is all the proof you need to understand how management is finding more ways each year to monetize its massive global user base.\n",

      "Due to its size and impressive history of financial performance, investors are already familiar with Apple. Even in the last five years, the stock has risen 300%, crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite Index by a wide margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are easy arguments to be made for why one would want to invest in Apple right now. For starters, the business has a top-notch balance sheet with $166 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Plus, Apple consistently produces tons of free cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's the strong brand, which is bolstered by the popular products I discussed earlier. The company's focus on the Services segment only expands the ecosystem, while keeping users locked in. Apple's customer loyalty is also hard to understate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But investors should be mindful of the current valuation. Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33 as of this writing, propelled by the share price rising 50% in 2023 alone. That valuation is significantly more expensive than Apple's trailing 10-year average P/E multiple of 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, there's always the company's huge scale to think about. Apple generated nearly $400 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue. Wall Street analysts forecast just 5.7% annualized revenue growth over the next five fiscal years. Even a company with this kind of pedigree can only move the needle so much from year to year. After two-plus decades of blistering growth, investors should temper their expectations going forward.\n",

The early impetus for shares was positive following Friday's U.S. data showing an easing in wage costs and core inflation, which fuelled hopes the Federal Reserve was done tightening. \"The data surprises bolster confidence that global core inflation - ex. China - will fall sharply and set the stage for a developed market central bank policy pause and emerging market easing even if growth remains firm,\" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan. Figures due this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, the July payrolls report and European inflation. China factory surveys are due later on Monday. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point, but markets are more divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will hike or stay on hold.

Investors are still pondering the implications of Friday's shock decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields, in a step away from its ultra-easy policies. Analysts at BofA estimate the BOJ's bond buying added $1.3 trillion to global liquidity in the past 18 months and provided a low floor for global rates, so any sustained rise in Japanese government bond yields could ripple though other bond markets.

      "* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei up 1.8%, S&P futures flat after firm July * China factory survey steadies, services disappoint * Yen slips anew in wake of BOJ shift on bond yields * Raft of earnings this week include Amazon and Apple By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 31 (Reuters) - Asian shares looked to end the month on a firm note on Monday in a week littered with major economic releases, central bank meetings and earnings updates from mega caps Amazon and Apple, though rising Japanese bond yields posed a risk. China surveys were mixed with factory activity just pipping forecasts but services disappointing, though both merely reinforced expectations that Beijing would have to launch larger stimulus at some point. Chinese blue chips <.CSI300> seemed unperturbed and added 1.6%, bringing gains for July to 5.6%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> climbed 1.1%, having gained almost 6% so far in July to reach a five-month high. The initial impetus for markets was positive following Friday's U.S. data showing an easing in wage costs and core inflation, which fuelled hopes the Federal Reserve was done tightening. \"The data surprises bolster confidence that global core inflation - ex. China - will fall sharply and set the stage for a developed market central bank policy pause and emerging market easing even if growth remains firm,\" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan. Figures due this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, the July payrolls report and European inflation.

Overall, investors have low expectations for its quarterly results, and they anticipate a further slowdown in sales projection for the following quarter with relatively flat earnings.\n",

      "Revenues are expected to decrease by 1.8% from previous year, totaling $81.5 billion. Due to the economic recession, the decline in hardware demand is expected to be the most prominent story. The company's income is heavily dependent on iPhone sales, and analysts predict that those figures will continue to drop, potentially by 2.2%, to $38.8 billion. Consistent growth in Apple's service offerings like AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and the App Store should contribute to a 5.8% increase in revenue, bringing total Apple revenue to $20.7 billion.\n",

      "If you're looking for a stock that can deliver consistent growth and dividends, you might want to consider Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The tech giant is the largest holding of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) accounting for a whopping 47% of its stock holdings at last count. Here are some of the factors that make Apple stock a compelling buy and hold right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's financial performance has been impressive in recent quarters, despite the headwinds of high interest rates, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, a slowing global economy, and geopolitical uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, for example, Apple reported revenue of $94.8 billion. This figure does mark a 3% decrease from the same quarter a year ago, but Apple still returned a staggering $23 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in the quarter. A business that can return that much cash to shareholders in a difficult operating environment is a model of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is also poised to benefit from the recovery of the global economy in 2024. Wall Street analysts project that the tech behemoth will grow its revenue by 6.7% in 2024. Mid-single-digit revenue growth is a remarkable achievement for a company with market value of over $3 trillion as of this writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key advantages Apple has over its competitors is its extremely loyal customer base. According to a survey by SellCell, a platform for selling used phones and tablets, 92% of iPhone owners plan to stick with Apple the next time they upgrade their devices. This figure is notably higher than the loyalty rates for competitors such as Samsung (85.7%) and Alphabet (84%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's loyal customers are willing not only to buy its hardware products but also its lineup of popular services, including Apple Pay and iTunes. That's great news, because Apple crossed the 2 billion active device user threshold last December. It thus has a huge customer base to leverage for its family of value-added services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Apple's customer loyalty is likely to increase further with the introduction of new features and products that enhance its ecosystem. For instance, Apple recently launched the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset. While the Vision Pro is unlikely to be a major revenue driver because of its hefty price point, cutting-edge innovations like this one are likely to attract even more customers and subsequently bolster retention rates even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its strong performance and growth prospects, Apple's stock is not overly expensive compared to its peers. At present, Apple's stock is trading at 29.6 times projected earnings. For comparison, Microsoft shares trade at over 30 times projected earnings, and Amazon shares exchange hands at over 82 times forward earnings. Apple's shares, in turn, are reasonably valued for a high-growth tech company.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's more, Apple stock offers a modest annualized dividend yield of 0.5% at current levels. While its dividend yield is below average for a large-cap company, its dividend is exceptionally well covered by earnings. Underscoring this point, Apple's trailing-12-month payout ratio of 15.5% is near rock bottom for a megacap company. Most of its peers, after all, sport payout ratios that consistently fall between 40% and 60%. Bottom line: The company should have no problem raising its dividend for the 12th consecutive year in the next fiscal period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett is a big fan of Apple for a host of reasons. It has stellar financials, a loyal customer base, a reasonable valuation, and a well-supported dividend program. So if you're looking for a stock that can deliver long-term value and income, you might want to follow Buffett's lead and buy Apple hand over fist right now.\n",

We expect earnings to stand at about $1.07 per share, slightly below consensus estimates. On the other hand, we expect revenues to come in about $74 billion, marking a decline of about 11% versus last year and marginally ahead of consensus estimates.

      "While Q3 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for Apple, we expect sales of products such as the Mac and iPad to also decline year-over-year, as the remote working trend eases and the broader PC and tablet markets cool. For perspective, over Q2 FY’23, Apple’s Mac sales declined by about 31% year-over-year. However, sales of the iPhone could prove a bit more resilient, given the traction that Apple is seeing in markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey where installment plans and trade-in programs are helping drive demand. Apple’s digital services business should partly help Apple ride out the lull in its hardware business driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. However, growth rates are likely to remain below the levels seen last year. That said, it is likely that Apple will continue to expand its gross margins for the quarter driven by a higher mix of service sales, more premium products, and also due to some cost savings.\n",

      "Despite already rising more than 50% this year, one analyst thinks shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have plenty of upside remaining over the next 12 months. More specifically, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar thinks the stock can get to $220 during this period. This price target would translate to about 12% upside for the stock, on top of an already impressive gain since Jan. 1.\n",

      "Is Apple stock really a good buy today, despite its staggering first seven months of 2023? Let's look closer at why Kumar is so upbeat about Apple shares to see if he's onto something.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a note to investors this week, Kumar said that he is raising his 12-month price target on Apple stock from $180 to $220. Supporting his view, he believes iPhone sales in China could be notable for the tech company's fiscal third quarter, which Apple will report results for on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Apple's fiscal second-quarterearnings call CEO Tim Cook noted that even though the company reported a 3% year-over-year decline in Greater China revenue during the period, sales in the market were up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. In addition, year-over-year sales trends for the quarter improved compared to the three months ending in December 2022. With China's economy continuing its reopening following strict COVID-19 policies that disrupted Apple's sales, further improvement is possible in fiscal Q2. Regarding iPhone sales trends specifically, Cook cited third-party data that estimated iPhone models to account for four of the top-selling smartphones in urban China. So Apple is certainly well-positioned in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though given recent headlines in the media about China's recovery being slower than anticipated, some investors are worried about Apple's how Greater China sales may have fared during fiscal Q3. But Kumar seems convinced that Apple's sales in the market may prove to be more resilient than anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going further, Kumar said that even if China sales do prove to be subpar, Apple's fast-growing sales in India could offset this weakness. To this end, Apple sales in India grew at a strong double-digit growth rate during fiscal Q2, Cook noted. \"There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,\" the CEO added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Apple stock may still be a buy\n",
      "\n",
      "While the analyst has some good points about China sales potentially being more resilient than anticipated and India serving as a timely catalyst for the iPhone maker, the bigger question is whether or not Apple stock is truly a good buy at 33 times earnings -- the premium valuation the stock is trading at today.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it would be difficult to call Apple stock a bargain today, it's fair to say that an investor who buys the stock today has a decent chance of making out reasonably well over the long haul. The tech giant has spent decades building a powerful hardware, software, and services ecosystem and a loyal customer base. Further, with an exceptional balance sheet boasting more cash than debt, and a cash flow statement showing off annual free cash flow of around $100 billion, Apple can continue investing heavily in maintaining its attractive positioning with consumers through product innovation, new services, and constant improvement of its existing software and services. Ultimately, the company's massive scale and loyal customer base combine to give it a competitive advantage that should help the company continue growing earnings for years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as Apple stock approaches $200, shares arguably still appear attractive. Of course, this doesn't mean shareholders won't have to endure bumpy ride with occasional large drawdowns in the stock price. Of course, despite these reasons to be bullish, investors should do their own due diligence to decide for themselves whether or not they think the stock is a buy.\n",

      "There is a good chance that Apple can strike gold with its next generation of iPhones as a massive installed base of users will need upgrades and the company has strong pricing power. But the tech giant is also taking steps to diversify into new areas to accelerate its growth. One way it hopes to do that is by jumping into the small but fast-growing market for mixed-reality headsets. There are also rumors that Apple is developing self-driving vehicles.\n",

      "Not surprisingly, several companies -- both big and small -- are in a race to deploy AI-powered chatbots. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently reported that Apple is also in this race. According to Gurman, Apple is reportedly building an AI-powered chatbot to compete with the likes of ChatGPT. Gurman adds that the tech giant has already developed a large language model (LLM) to power its generative AI offerings, including the chatbot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple won't say if it is indeed looking to jump into the generative AI market. But the rumor mill has gotten better in recent years at predicting the company's upcoming products. That suggests that Apple may indeed be on track to jump into this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why AI could open a new growth frontier for Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't be surprising to see Apple actually move into the generative AI space. The chatbot market is expected to be huge in the long run. And chatbots are just one of the many applications that use generative AI technology. The overall generative AI market is forecast to grow 42% annually over the next decade and generate $1.3 trillion in annual revenue in 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. So, it makes sense for Apple to accelerate its efforts to incorporate generative AI into its offerings, especially considering that other tech giants, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have already made progress in this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI offerings like chatbots could nicely complement Apple's huge installed base of devices and unlock growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook said in February that the company's installed base of devices, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and other hardware offerings, now exceeds 2 billion units. So the company already has access to a huge user base that could adopt its generative AI offerings. If Apple charges a fee for the service, that would create a significant new revenue stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple could consider doing something similar with Siri, its AI-powered voice assistant, which is present on multiple devices ranging from iPhones to iPads to AirPods to the Apple Watch. Apple could use generative AI to make Siri smarter, using its large language models, and deploy the functionality in its productivity apps, such as Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, as well. If Siri can compose emails, create text such as essays, and write poems based on user prompts -- just like ChatGPT -- Apple could consider monetizing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no official word from Apple if it is indeed looking to move into this market. But don't be surprised to see the company integrate generative AI into its products going forward, as other big tech giants could steal market share from Apple if it doesn't step up its efforts in this area. Also, there is a huge incentive for Apple to accelerate its generative AI efforts as it already has a solid opportunity to monetize this technology and give its flagging growth a big shot in the arm.\n",

But analysts, on average, are expecting Apple to report a narrower year-over-year decline for the three-month period ended in June (fiscal Q3).\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, investors will likely look to Apple's quarterly results to see if any trends or commentary from management point to a possible return to top-line growth later this year. Returning to growth during such a tough macroeconomic environment would make a great case for the resilience of Apple's business. On the other hand, worsening sales trends could be a red flag -- one that could lead investors to believe shares aren't worth their current pricey valuation of more than 33 times earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Apple's fiscal third-quarter earnings report approaches, let's review what the tech company said about its sales trends when it reported its most recent results. The exercise provides some hints about whether the company could return to growth later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most objective evidence of improving sales trends at Apple was the fact that revenue in fiscal Q2 was down only 3% year over year. This compared to a 5% decline in fiscal Q1. Additionally, Apple's services business revenue reached a fiscal second-quarter record, and its installed base of active devices hit an all-time high. Further, Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri noted that the company's revenue actually increased year-over-year on a constant currency basis -- and that growth was broad-based, with year-over-year revenue growth \"in the majority of the markets we track.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that Apple's business performance during this uncertain environment is better than it looks, as the iPhone maker has been facing currency exchange headwinds. Indeed, Apple management's outlook for its year-over-year revenue growth rate expectation in fiscal Q3 bakes in an expected negative year-over-year foreign exchange impact of almost 4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Apple reports for fiscal Q3 revenue, investors will likely look particularly closely at any commentary about how revenue could fare in fiscal Q4. Analysts, on average, are currently modeling for a return to very small growth during the period. For Apple to meet analysts' expectations, the company will need to guide for revenue of about $90.4 billion, or 0.2% year-over-year growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, fiscal Q2 sales trends and management's commentary during the quarter paint a picture for a likely scenario of Apple returning to growth by fiscal Q4. But investors should be prepared for a wide range of outcomes in such an uncertain market. With such rapid increases in interest rates from the Federal Reserve and an inflationary environment, uncertainty is high and forecasts are difficult.\n",

      "Indeed, investors didn't seem too enthused by the numbers, as shares are currently lower today following the results. I believe the major headline that should have grabbed investors' attention is the strong growth in Services, up 8%, and the insightful commentary on AI from Apple's CEO, Tim Cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "During theearnings call Cook stated that Apple has been working on AI, including generative AI, for many years. Indeed, this is pretty unsurprising commentary from Apple's top boss, who's probably been hounded to shed more detail on the company's longer-term AI plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Cook didn't say anything game-changing or shocking about Apple's AI ambitions, I do respect that he doesn't appear to be trying to build up any AI hype, at least not to the magnitude of some of the other tech companies out there that can't seem to go a few sentences without mentioning generative AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undeniably, LLMs like ChatGPT are definitely a work in progress, and there's a lot of reputational risk on the line by putting a consumer-facing AI product out there. While Microsoft may be comfortable taking such risks to be an early mover in the AI race, Apple does not seem to be, at least not yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI regulations and potential downsides arise, I'd look for Apple to be more comfortable making a bigger splash into the uncertain AI waters. Until then, expect the company to keep tabs on the state of the emerging technology as it looks to incorporate various aspects to \"enrich people's lives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, Apple seems to be playing the long game with AI, putting people first rather than profits. Moving forward, I expect the company to do more of the same. The latest iOS update may not have AppleGPT, but it does have AI technologies (think the iOS 17's AI-powered Auto-Correct) to help improve numerous aspects of the user experience.\n",

      "Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n",
      "\n",
      "On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there have been 23 Buys and eight Hold recommendations assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target is $206.80, implying upside potential of 13.35%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $240.00 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, some may view 13.35% as a modest return for the year ahead. Apple shares are trading on the expensive side of their historical range (the stock's averaged a 25.5 times trailing price-to-earnings multiple over the last five years) at 31 times trailing price-to-earnings. Still, I expect price target hikes to come in as more analysts re-evaluate Apple's longer-term potential in AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way I see it, getting into the pool from the shallow end is far less risky than the deep end if you're not sure what lies beneath the water. Although it may not seem like it, Apple's a long-term AI winner, albeit a quiet one, for now!\n",

      "Warren Buffett's top stocks often make for good long-term investments. But this year, only one of the top five holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio is beating the markets. And while it's only a handful of stocks that are carrying the S&P 500's strong 18% gains this year, it has still been a largely lackluster year for most of these Buffett stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) account for a combined 74% of Berkshire's stock portfolio. Here's how these stocks have performed this year, in order from worst to best:\n",

      "Apple: +48%\n",
      "\n",
      "The only Berkshire stock on this list that has outperformed the S&P 500 this year is Apple. The tech giant has soared due to its resilient results this year, coupled with a comeback in tech. What's also helping Apple is that it has been working on developing more growth opportunities. Earlier this year, it announced the launch of its Vision Pro headsets, which give customers the ability to experience content for both virtual and augmented reality. There are also rumors that it is working on its own version of ChatGPT, which some engineers are referring to as \"Apple GPT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There's still more growth ahead for the business, but investors should be careful not to get too excited about Apple as its valuation has gotten a bit pricey amid the hype in tech stocks this year. And while Apple has grown its dividend over the years, it remains relatively modest at just 0.5%.\n",

      "Keith Noonan: If you're looking to replicate Buffett's investing moves, it makes sense to own Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in your portfolio. In a stunning vote of confidence, the Oracle of Omaha has made the tech stock Berkshire Hathaway's largest portfolio holding by far. Apple currently accounts for 46.9% of the company's stock portfolio. For comparison, Bank of America is Berkshire's second-largest stock position and makes up 8.9% of its total portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, Apple has often ranked as the world's most profitable company or taken second place behind oil giant Saudi Aramco. The tech giant stands as the world's largest company and currently has a market capitalization of nearly $3.1 trillion. Buffett loves companies with strong brands that are capable of serving up consistent profits, and Apple's world-beating business performance has made the stock a big winner for Berkshire Hathaway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berkshire first bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2016, and investing in the tech giant has played a huge role in powering the tech conglomerate to beating the S&P 500 index since then. Berkshire's share price has climbed 171% since the beginning of 2016, handily topping the S&P 500 index's total return of 158% across the stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Apple stock has delivered a dividend-adjusted total return of 718% across the stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to claiming more than 85% of global operating profits from smartphone sales, Apple has been gaining ground in the computers market, growing its software-and-services segment and scoring wins in emerging categories like wearable hardware. With one of the strongest brands in the tech space and a proven penchant for design excellence, the company could also go on to be a big winner in categories like augmented reality, smart cars, and artificial-intelligence-powered personal assistants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's brand and ecosystem strengths are unmatched in the consumer hardware space, and the company will likely continue to be a technology leader for decades to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple and Visa are classic, Buffett-style stocks\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to picking stocks, Warren Buffett famously prefers to keep it simple and avoid companies and situations that are overly complex. Within that mold, Apple and Visa are large, well-known companies that can be counted on to reliably generate significant profits. They might not be the most explosive stocks on the market, but they offer well-balanced risk-reward profiles, and it's not hard to see why Buffett's company has invested in them.\n",

      "According to data from Stockcircle, Apple represents 49.27% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio. It’s also the conglomerate’s biggest holding. Further, the Oracle of Omaha loves the tech giant. As Barron’s stated, Buffett appreciates that Apple keeps repurchasing stock and thereby increasing Berkshire’s percentage ownership with no effort on the latter entity’s part.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, Apple isn’t a perfect idea among billionaires’ favorite stocks. Several days ago, the semiconductor space fell sharply because of concerns associated with fading smartphone demand. Still, in the long run, Apple’s brand power should resonate with the market. Therefore, it’s a reasonably comfortable buy.\n",
      "\n",

      "I use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google ((NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products. The problem is that none of them give me everything I’m looking for all at once. If one did, I’d immediately get rid of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company that has gotten the closest to creating a flourishing closed ecosystem is Apple. It’s become a Products-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider where its hardware revenue is gradually being eclipsed by services revenue. In this situation, you buy fewer iPhones but more services to use on your phone and other Apple devices.\n",

      "1. Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "At a stake worth over $150 billion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) represents nearly 50% of Berkshire's portfolio, making the tech company by far and away the largest position it holds. Interestingly enough, it wasn't Warren Buffett who initiated his company's position in the $3 trillion company back in 2016; rather, it was his two investing managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Buffett, who once claimed \"technology is just something we don't understand, so we don't invest in it,\" has undoubtedly warmed up to Apple. At Berkshire's most recent annual meeting, Buffett called Apple a \"better business than any other we own [outright]\".\n",
      "\n",
      "As for why Buffett's love grew for Apple, the company returns an incredible amount of capital to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. First, Apple has grown its dividend by nearly 17% annually over the last 10 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Apple spends a fortune each year on share repurchases, including $90 billion in its fiscal-year 2022 and $38 billion during the first half of its fiscal-year 2023. As a result of Apple's aggressive share buybacks, the company has lowered its outstanding share count by 37.5% over the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett is a fan of share repurchases at reasonable prices because an investor's ownership stake can increase without purchasing any additional shares. For Berkshire, that meant its position in Apple grew from 5.39% in 2020 to 5.55% in 2021 without purchasing a single share. Since then, Berkshire has added to its Apple stake several times, and its ownership level reached 5.8% at the end of its first quarter of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the bear case for Apple, if Warren Buffett calls it his best business, it's going to be difficult to find anything wrong with the company. However, the stock does look on the expensive side when using a popular valuation metric like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which measures the stock price in relation to the company's earnings. For Apple, its P/E ratio currently sits near 33, which is higher than its five-year average of 25.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, for a company like Apple, which has a history of excellence and the backing of Warren Buffett, long-term investors should consider dollar-cost averaging into one of the best businesses ever created if they are worried about its current valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berkshire Hathaway first purchased Kroger (NYSE: KR) in late 2019, and similar to Apple, the idea came from one of Buffett's lieutenants. Shares of the leading operator of grocery stores in the U.S. are up roughly 70% since then, handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500's nearly 50% return. While Berkshire has both added and trimmed its position in Kroger, it still has a nearly 7% ownership stake in the grocery store operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kroger is another dividend stock, having paid and raised its dividend for 17 consecutive years. Currently, Kroger pays its shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share, representing an annual dividend yield of 2.4%. Similar to Apple, Kroger's management is buying back its own stock hand over fist, having repurchased 30% of its outstanding shares during the last 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warren Buffett is often referred to as the Oracle of Omaha for finding and buying stocks that have tremendous upside over the long term. While Buffett didn't first pick these two particular stocks, they have both been bright spots in Berkshire's portfolio due to their dominance in their respective industries and growing dividends. That should help make Apple and Kroger compelling additions to any long-term investor's portfolio.\n",

      "As was widely anticipated, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported lower year-over-year revenue for its quarter ending in early July. The decline wasn't as dramatic as feared, however. Its top line fell from $83 billion a year earlier to $81.8 billion this time around versus estimates of $81.7 billion. Earnings grew from $1.20 per share then to $1.26 now, topping estimates of $1.19 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, declining iPhone revenue is a key culprit in this third consecutive quarterly revenue dip. Apple only sold $39.7 billion worth of the popular smartphone during its third fiscal quarter of the year, down from the year-ago comparison of just under $40.7 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let there be no mistake -- the revenue dip isn't solely the result of lower selling prices. Apple is selling fewer iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Longtime followers of Apple stock already know the company stopped sharing unit sales data back in 2018. Other in-the-know observers have continued to track unit sales anyway, confirming what many investors quietly suspect: Apple isn't selling as many iPhones as it used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not entirely Apple's fault. As the graphic above also shows, the whole smartphone market has been shrinking since 2017. Consumers are keeping their increasingly expensive devices for longer, and there are fewer cellphone owners left to convert to smartphone users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple shareholders need not worry just yet, though. The company's more than ready for this slowdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's Q3 press release alluded to the growth engine that's picking up the slack being left behind by iPhone sales. CEO Tim Cook explained, \"We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions.\" Services revenue grew from $19.6 billion in the third fiscal quarter of 2022 to $21.2 billion a quarter ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's quarterly reporting doesn't make this terribly clear to the casual observer. But profit margin rates on services are much higher than the company's profit margins on physical products. For perspective, last quarter's product sales of $60.6 billion cost Apple $39.1 billion, leaving behind a profit of $21.5 billion, or 35.5% of revenue. Services revenue of $21.2 billion, on the other hand, only cost the company $6.2 billion. That's a difference of $15 billion, translating into a profit margin rate of 70.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of Apple's revenue obviously still comes from sales of physical products. So, most of its gross profits also still come from sales of goods like iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers (although iPhones make up the majority of these sales).\n",
      "\n",
      "Buy Apple stock because it's handling the shift like a champ\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't misread the message. Apple would love to have more of both types of revenue, as the ongoing proliferation of iPhones is the key driver of its Services arm's sales and profit growth. As Cook explained in the press release, the company watched its \"installed base of active devices reach an all-time high\" in the same quarter Services revenue reached a record as well. Connect the dots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, the company's got a great plan B that's not only already in place but is already working even as the company is still learning how to extract more revenue from iPhone owners (and iOS users in general). As it gets better at doing this, don't be surprised to see Services eclipse Products as Apple's top profit center. That would be a much more consistent business to prioritize anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line? Shares of Apple fell following Thursday's post-close release of last quarter's numbers, with investors largely concerned about the third-straight sales slump. Don't sweat it. The dip just makes for an even better buying opportunity.\n",

      "So it’s logical, now, to look under the hood at a couple of tech leaders. Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett had done just that, digging deep into Amazon and Apple to gauge their attraction for investors. His conclusions are interesting, and worth a second look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple (AAPL)\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is Apple, the maker of the iconic iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines.

      "\n",
      "Apple is also making use of AI technology – and in-line with its history, the company is taking a creative approach to the field. Rather than try to build new AI systems, Apple this past June released a number of new software features that make use of AI to create a more seamless user experience. The company is integrating a AI-powered language model into the autocorrect feature of the iPhone line, so that the smartphone will learn how to correct its own user – by how that user types. Also, Apple is working AI into the AirPods; the Pro model of the popular earbuds will recognize when wearers are engaged in a conversation, and turn off the noise-canceling feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, investors have long recognized that Apple is a long-term play, a consumer giant that has proven to be recession-resistant. In a recent example of the company’s resilience, wee can look at PC shipments during 2Q23. Overall, customers retrenched during the quarter, and shipments of PCs were down 13% y/y – but Apple’s MacBooks saw a 10% y/y quarterly gain in shipments.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apple continues its long-term trend of delivering return on investment, solid profits, and popular consumer products, the company’s stock fell 5% after its earnings release for fiscal 3Q23 due to concerns over hardware sales. While the iPhone gained market share, the device’s overall sales were still down y/y, from $40.67 billion to $39.67 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, the company recorded its third straight quarter of dwindling sales, dialing in total revenues of $81.8 billion, slipping 1.4% y/y although the figure met Street expectations. Apple’s earnings figure, of $1.26 per diluted share, was 7 cents ahead of the forecasts but that wasn’t enough to stave off the bears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking in again with Barton Crockett, we find the analyst is also somewhat pessimistic on Apple, at least for the near-term. Crockett has shifted his stance, noting that Apple’s long upward trend has put it at a peak valuation, and that it’s simply not possible to predict future successful products.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After a mixed F3Q23 that highlights the slowdown phase in which Apple now sits, we downgrade the stock to NEUTRAL from BUY... Apple makes the most important device of the modern economy -- the iPhone -- has executed an impressive upgrade to Macs with the pivot to Apple Silicon, and is re-accelerating services. But a slowdown in the U.S. seems likely to last until a material new product category takes hold. And that is uncertain both in timing and success, leaving little reason to favor shares now trading near peak absolute and relative multiples,” Crockett says of the stock, in his recent note.\n",

      "While the rating has been downgraded, Crockett’s price target for Apple, $198, indicates his belief in a 9% upside over the next 12 months.\n",

      "The stock prices for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) went in opposite directions on Aug. 4 after the companies released their latest earnings reports.

      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon's stock price soared 8% after its second-quarter beat indicated its e-commerce and cloud businesses were recovering. So is it the right time to sell Apple and buy Amazon? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did Apple disappoint the market?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has two soft spots: its dependence on the iPhone, which accounted for 53% of its revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, and its heavy exposure to China, which accounted for a fifth of its global sales during the same period. The bears believe Apple's sales of iPhones will stall out as consumers upgrade their smartphones less frequently, and that it faces both competitive and supply chain challenges in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's iPhone sales declined 2% year over year to $39.7 billion in the third quarter, which missed the consensus forecast of $39.9 billion. However, that slowdown was entirely caused by currency headwinds, which offset its record third-quarter iPhone sales in India and other overseas markets. On a constant-currency basis, Apple's iPhone sales actually rose year over year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Apple's Greater China revenue grew 8% year over year, accelerating from the region's 3% decline in the second quarter. As for the competition, Apple actually grew its market share year over year from 18% to 20% in China, according to Counterpoint Research, as all four of its top competitors -- Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Xiaomi (OTC: XIACF) -- experienced year-over-year declines. Therefore, China should remain a fertile market for Apple for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulls will also point out that Apple's services revenue, which accounted for 21% of its top line in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, grew 8% year over year in the third quarter. It added 150 million subscriptions across all of its services over the past 12 months, and surpassed 1 billion paid subscriptions for the first time -- and the stickiness of those subscriptions should keep its customers locked into its hardware and prisoner-taking ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to both decline 2% in fiscal 2023, but the upcoming launch of the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro, its expansion into India and other emerging markets, and the monetization of its services should stabilize its business. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 7% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.

But what you're really getting with Apple's dividend is growth. The quarterly payment has increased annually for 12 consecutive years, more than doubling over the last decade.

      "\n",
      "During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett called Apple \"a better business than any [other] we own.\" It's hard to argue against that statement. We all know about the Apple business model. The company's ecosystem is a textbook example of vertical integration, and the brand is synonymous with blending design and functionality.\n",

Apple's operating system is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with its ecosystem of apps, devices, and services. This creates a high switching cost for customers who want to keep using their favorite features, such as iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, and more.

      "Perhaps the most important revelation was that Apple had amassed more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, helping fuel the performance of the services segment.

Apple has more than 1 billion active iPhones in the wild, meaning there are nearly as many subscribers as iPhone users.

      "While inflation has been the biggest drag on Apple's results, the strong dollar continues to skew the company's financial results, as sales made in foreign currencies translate into fewer dollars.

In the third quarter, Apple's revenue was 4% lower than it would have been, because of foreign exchange headwinds.\n",

      "Yet despite those obstacles, Apple's profits were surprisingly robust. Net income increased 2% year over year, while earnings per share climbed nearly 6%. It's also worth noting that Apple continues to generate an enviable amount of cash, with operating cash flow of $89 billion during the first nine months of its fiscal 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Apple has a strong track record of shareholder-friendly policies. Since the company reinstituted its dividend in 2012, Apple has increased its payout by 154%. While its 0.50% yield might seem paltry, that's a function of the stock's magnificent performance, with gains of more than 1,000% over the past 10 years. The company also bought back more than 103 million shares, worth $18 billion. That means existing shareholders are entitled to a larger percentage of Apple's profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some investors might balk at the idea of \"holding forever,\" the way things stand right now, Apple stock is as close as it gets to a sure thing. With more than 1 billion active iPhones, users will continue to shell out money for apps, subscriptions, and other services, fueling the company's flywheel of growth.\n",

However, given the stock's years of consistent performance, a powerful roster of recurring revenue, and the historically high pent-up demand for its flagship iPhone, the evidence is clear that Apple is one stock you can buy now and hold forever.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think there's an easy answer to the question posed earlier: The good times are unequivocably not over for Apple stock. One disappointing quarterly update doesn't change the overall story for any company, especially one with such an impressive track record of success as Apple.\n",
      "\n",

      "In my view, Apple's shares could be range-bound for a while. The lack of growth combined with the stock's valuation might not be overly attractive to many investors.\n",

      "However, I suspect that the current pullback could also be an opportunity for long-term investors. Apple's ecosystem remains strong.

      "Apple's fiscal third quarter, which ended July 1, was far from impressive. Total revenue sank 1.4% year over year, driven by a 4.7% decline in product revenue. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple's total revenue, suffered a 2.5% sales decline. Sales of Macs were down 7.3%, while sales of iPads tumbled 19.8%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Apple expects its total revenue to decline by a similar amount, and for both Macs and iPads to suffer double-digit declines.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apple's earnings per share increased to $1.26 in the third quarter, compared to $1.20 in the prior-year period, that earnings growth was the result of a lower tax rate and share buybacks. Operating income was down slightly year over year.\n",

The iPhone business is mature, and while services revenue is growing, it's not growing all that fast.\n",

      "\n",
      "Apple's market capitalization sat at $2.86 trillion at the end of last week. Based on the average analyst estimate for full-year earnings, Apple stock trades for more than 30 times earnings. Excluding the pandemic, this is the most expensive Apple stock has been in at least a decade. Does that make sense? In my opinion, no.\n",

      "In an ultra-low interest rate world where the risk-free option provides basically no return at all, paying 30 times earnings for Apple stock could be a reasonable thing to do.

Its hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, the AirPods wireless earbuds, the AirPods Max headphones, and the HomePod smart speaker line. Apple's software includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, the Shazam music identifier, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, and Xcode. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iMessage, and iCloud. Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card. Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days.

That left the company with cash and short-term marketable securities of about $118 billion, more than any other company in the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) aside from Apple’s (AAPL) total of about $167 billion. Investors are awaiting any detailed plans the company has for its massive cash influx.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors expect companies sitting on large amounts of cash to invest the funds for better returns or give the cash back to shareholders. While Apple gives back most of its excess cash to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends, Alphabet has a less clearly defined strategy, leaving investors wondering about its reinvestment plans. Synovus Trust said, “Investors haven’t really had to address this issue with Alphabet in the past because they haven’t been as prolific with generating this kind of cash.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from Bloomberg, the top three cash generators in the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft (MSFT), have generated a combined $84 billion in Q2, the biggest increase for any such non-holiday period in history. In April, Alphabet boosted its stock buybacks and expanded its repurchase authorization to $70 billion. However, last quarter, the company spent $15 billion on its shares, barely half the cash it brought in.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, let's take a look at whether Apple or Alphabet stock is the better buy this August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has built up a reputation among investors for being one of the most reliable stocks on the market. The company's shares have risen 247% in the last five years, significantly higher than fellow tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Apple's reliability came alongside nearly unrivaled dominance in the consumer tech industry, with leading market shares in most of its product categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Apple's stock has faltered since the start of August, dipping 8% after its earnings release for the fiscal third quarter of 2023, which ended July 1. Macroeconomic headwinds caused reductions in consumer spending across tech, with Apple reporting sales declines in its iPhone, Mac, and iPad segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the challenging quarter, Apple demonstrated its strength by outperforming its competitors. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31), when iPhone sales fell 6% year over year, Samsung's smartphone sales decreased by 37%, and Motorola's tumbled 17%. Apple's performance allowed it to gain market share in smartphones, increasing from 52% to 55% in the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's recent stumble is why keeping a long-term perspective on its stock is crucial. The company might not be out of the woods amid poor market conditions. However, growing positions in artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, and digital services will likely provide substantial gains in the next five to 10 years and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Apple or Alphabet the better buy?\n",
      "\n",
      "As two of the world's most valuable companies, it's hard to go wrong with Apple or Alphabet. Both organizations have a history of offering investors reliable long-term growth, primarily thanks to the ever-expanding nature of the tech industry. Alphabet has massively profited from the steady growth of platforms like Google and YouTube, while high demand for Apple's products has helped it dominate the consumer market.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the chart above indicates Alphabet is trading at a better value than Apple. Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio are several points below the same metrics for Apple, suggesting your investment could go further with the Google company.\n",
      "\n",

      "To this day, the iPhone still represents more than half of all of Apple's revenue ($157 billion of the $294 billion total through the first nine months of Apple's current fiscal year). More robust, profitable iPhone growth will be a must for Apple stock to justify its high premium of 30 times trailing-12-month earnings (or 28 times free cash flow). Top mobile chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) provides some hints on what could lay ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is responsible for much of this consumer electronics exposure, with 64% of Skyworks' total revenue of $1.07 billion in its own June 2023 quarter tied to Apple (so, about $685 million in sales from Apple). Of that total, about 85% comes from the iPhone specifically, with devices like the iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch making up the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has said it expects some sequential increases in iPhone sales for the next quarter, which will end in September, and Skyworks seems to confirm this. However, this is largely a seasonal effect from new iPhone model launches as well as device manufacturing ramping up through the year in support of the holiday shopping frenzy every late autumn and early winter. Skyworks said its September revenue is expected to be $1.215 billion at the midpoint of guidance, up about 13% to 14% from last quarter, but importantly, down about 14% from the same period in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a further hint that Skyworks' diversification efforts, and not the Apple iPhone, are what's driving the sequential increase (but annual decline), Skyworks' CEO, Liam Griffin, rattled off a number of new chip product launches. Wi-Fi 6E and early Wi-Fi 7 modems are rolling out. 5G network infrastructure buildout is ongoing. And chips for smart home devices like Samsung soundbars and wearable tech like earbuds are growing markets for Skyworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When adding up the sum of all commentary, it's safe to assume that Apple's marquee iPhone business shouldn't be relied upon as a key growth driver anymore -- at least, not anytime soon. Smartphones have matured into a more stable, though highly profitable, source of income for Apple and its suppliers like Skyworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "New devices will propel growth going forward. For Apple, maybe it will be Vision Pro, which Skyworks undoubtedly will supply connectivity chips for. And for Skyworks, it still has work to do to diversify its business. But early work in automotive continues to look promising. Late in 2022, Skyworks' management had commented that auto sales were at about $200 million per year, so Griffin's recent dialogue indicates smart cars are a modest growth outlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "For myself and my ownership of both Apple and Skyworks shares, I rank both as a hold. Apple has a high premium it will need to prove with a return to growth in 2024. Until then, I believe the Apple stock run-up is mostly over.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Skyworks, it has a far cheaper valuation at less than 17 times trailing-12-month earnings and just 12 times free cash flow. However, overall it isn't a growth business anymore -- at least, not until it can scale up its non-smartphone and non-Apple business to a more significant level. For now, Skyworks needs an iPhone rebound, and that doesn't exactly look like a promising bet for 2023.\n",

      "One of the best investments in recent years was the decision to buy shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Buffett first bought a stake in the iPhone maker in the first quarter of 2016. Since the start of that year, a $10,000 investment would have turned into about $68,000 (as of Aug. 9), translating to a monster return of 579% that trounces the overall market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's attractive qualities\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not difficult to figure out why Buffett was drawn to Apple more than seven years ago. For starters, the company is known for selling some of the most in-demand products in the world. Buffett likes to own businesses that delight their customers, and Apple does this better than anyone else. The iPhone, for example, continues to introduce new upgrades that consumers absolutely love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not too long before Buffett invested in the company, Apple released the first model of the Watch in April 2015. And after Berkshire was already a shareholder, the company launched the AirPods in September 2016. Both products have been fantastic success stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett realized that a more accurate assessment of Apple would be possible by viewing it as a consumer brand instead of just a tech business. Without a doubt, Apple's economic moat, a term Buffett is famous for coming up with, stems from its incredible brand recognition. According to Interbrand, Apple has the most valuable brand in the world, worth an estimated $482 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's financial situation was outstanding. In fiscal 2015 (ended Sept. 26 of that year), the company posted revenue and diluted earnings-per-share growth of 28% and 43%, respectively, with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $206 billion. The thinking was probably that Apple's earnings power would be significantly higher five or 10 years from then, prompting the Oracle of Omaha to be extremely intrigued by Apple's trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett also takes a long hard look at the leadership team running a particular company. When Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, investors thought that Tim Cook wouldn't be able to be as successful in guiding Apple to new heights. But we've learned that this assumption was wrong. Even Buffett agrees. \"Tim Cook has managed that company in an extraordinary way,\" he said about Apple's current CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of 2016, Apple's market capitalization was just under $600 billion, so it was the world's most valuable company then, too. But the stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio on Jan. 1, 2016, was 11. Certainly, Buffett viewed this valuation as being very attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any investor would benefit by not only studying the great investors, but by also learning about successful investments. Buffett and Apple, respectively, fit into these categories without question.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion right now, and with the stock trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 30, Apple is obviously selling at a much higher premium than when Buffett got involved. But Berkshire is likely still a shareholder because of the huge dividends that the company receives thanks to its nearly 6% stake in the tech giant.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the individual investor thinking about buying Apple today, it's best to accept the fact that the business likely won't register the same monster growth in the future that it has posted in past years. Nonetheless, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple introduced another game-changing product or service that moves the needle financially.\n",

      "Apple's revenues have followed a fairly predictable cyclical pattern in recent years, as sales peak in the September and December quarters, and then taper off through the rest of the year.

However, Apple compounded the blow of its iPhone sales miss by warning that it expects to announce another year-over-year revenue decline for its September quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall in iPhone sales, which still makes up almost half of the company's total quarterly net sales, can be attributed to two reasons. First, higher inflation and interest rates have shifted the spending habits of many potential customers away from discretionary purchases like smartphones in 2023. Second, the new iPhone 15 models are set to launch in September, as per Apple's tradition. Consequently, customers may have delayed iPhone purchases during the quarter at a higher rater than normal.\n",

Each time Apple has debuted a new product, whether it has been the Macbook or the iPhone, a tectonic shift has been experienced in the way consumers use tech in their daily lives. Although the company charges a premium for its devices, the utility has far outweighed the cons for many loyal consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Apple has slowed down somewhat in terms of its product innovation in recent times. Its mixed-reality headset - the Vision Pro, announced in June 2023 - was its first new product in a long while. However, I believe the headset, which will tentatively be available in early 2024, will take some time to gain traction among consumers, even hardcore loyal Apple enthusiasts - due to its price point as well as the nascent stage of adoption for the wider metaverse space.\n",

      "Dylan Lewis: This week we also got updates from, I think, two of the biggest companies that move the US economy. We got Apple and Amazon earnings. Jason, Apple did something that it has not done since 2016 this earnings season, it posted its third consecutive quarter of revenue declines. The story seven years ago was struggling iPhone sales. History has a habit of repeating itself. We are in the same spot again here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Moser: Sure. I think the big focus is on the slowing revenue as you said. The third straight quarter of declining year-over-year revenue. I think that's just part of the ebb and flow of this business. It's gotten so big through the years thanks to that lightning in a bottle that is the iPhone. Remember too, there are some currency impacts that point to this, so you can fiddle with the numbers however you really want. But I do think it'd be whose investors to remember that Apple does a lot of things well, I think that it's greater than the sum of its many impressive parts. When you look at the numbers, they're leading up to this release of this new iPhone toward the end of the year, overall revenue down just 1%, but that included four percentage points of currency headwinds. iPhone revenue, as you mentioned down 2% Mac revenue down 7%, iPad is down 20. Wearables, home accessories up 2%. I think the real story here we've been talking about Apple as a services business and this quarter that really panned out well for them, services revenue up 10%. They've passed one billion total paid subscriptions. Now they added 150 million from a year ago, I think that's a big part of the story here is they're really doing a good job of monetizing that massive installed base. That massive installed base isn't going anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dylan Lewis: Jason, I mentioned that seven-year look before and how we are in a period that looks awfully similar to 2016. Back then, Apple did not have this incredibly strong services business, and it's benefited from that growth over the last seven years. Stocks up over 500% since 2016. Where does the growth come from in the future to offset some of the reliance that this business has in the iPhone segment?\n",

Share count down 17.5% since 2018 alone. Also, look toward India like we've been talking about China over the last decade as the opportunity for Apple, and that's worked out very well.

Investors who took that advice have made a lot of money. The stock has since returned 41,710%, meaning an initial investment of $2,500 would be worth $1 million today.\n",

      "But there is a more interesting story here: After first recommending Apple, Munster made a number of prescient predictions. For instance, he became the first analyst to posit Apple as a $1 trillion company in 2012, a forecast that came to fruition in 2018. He then correctly called Apple's ascent to $2 trillion in 2020, and shortly thereafter, he upped his target to $3 trillion, a prediction that came to pass in 2023.\n",

      "Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) rallied to a 1-year high earlier this month and are up +67% this year due to resurgent profit and revenue growth. Amazon is up +5% this month, while other mega-cap technology stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all fallen.

      "Take Apple for example. In its fiscal third quarter (ended July 1), the company generated revenue of $83 billion. Even after spending nearly $7 billion on research and development and paying all its other expenses, Apple still had net income of $19 billion and operating cash flow of $26 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a misconception among investors that once a company starts paying a dividend, its growth is over, but as Apple has shown over the past decade or so, that's patently untrue. The iPhone maker resumed paying a dividend in 2012 and, since that time, expanded its payouts by 154%. During the same period, its stock increased by 729% -- which should put to rest any fears about stalling growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the company's significant cash generation, Apple uses just 16% of its profits -- called a payout ratio -- to fund its dividend. Let's use that as a starting point to estimate what Alphabet could pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even amid the worst downturn in decades, Alphabet still generated net income of roughly $60 billion last year. If the company were to use 16% of that amount to fund a dividend, that works out to just under $10 billion or roughly $0.76 annually per share, with a yield of about 0.5% -- slightly higher than Apple's current yield of 0.4%. If Alphabet opted instead to pay out 25% of its profits, that would work out to about $15 billion, resulting in a payout of $1.19 per share annually, or a yield of about 1%.\n",

More recently, however, an uptick in economic uncertainties - punctuated by high-profile downgrades from Fitch and Moody's, along with a lackluster sales forecast from sector heavyweight Apple (AAPL) - has paused the breakout rally that characterized the first half of 2023.\n",

Those include the usual mega-cap tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Concentration risk like this can bee seen in indexes across all market capitalization sizes, including small-cap and mid-cap stocks. In fact, concentration risk poses an even larger liquidity challenge to small-cap and mid-cap index portfolios. In a market also threatened by continued rising rates, stubborn inflation, and a still-looming recession risk, finding the right ETF matters.

      "The challenging quarter aligns with broader market conditions as U.S. smartphone shipments fell 24% and global PC shipments tumbled 13% in Q2.

Meanwhile, its stock has climbed 242% in the same period, more than those of tech companies such as Microsoft and Alphabet. Apple's history of growth and dominance in tech indicate it won't be down for long, making it an attractive growth stock to add to your portfolio this month.\n",

      "In Q3, the company spent $23 billion on research and development, an increase of about $3 billion from the previous year.

      "Apple's stock dip has pushed its forward price-to-earnings ratio below 30 for the first time since June. While the stock isn't exactly a bargain buy, it rarely goes much lower. As a result, it's not a bad idea to consider buying the dip. Product sales are likely to recover alongside easing inflation over the next year.

We then compared that number to the sum total of AAPL shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2023 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for AAPL.

In fact, Apple stock has given up close to 6% in thirty days, while the S&P 500 index has risen almost 1%. But don't expect that under-performance to continue, according to analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing what he calls the “AI gold-rush,” which he believes will propel tech stocks to add another 12% to 15% before the end of the year, Ives listed Apple among the tech stocks that should be bought on any pullback. \"From the hundreds of conference calls we listened to over the past month [it's] clear that the AI theme is changing the enterprise and consumer landscape going forward and creating a bifurcated spending environments for the winners and losers in this backdrop,\" Ives wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple which lost 22% of its value in 2022, has gained 37% year to date, besting the 16% rise in the S&P 500 index. Over the past six months, the stock has risen some 18%, while the S&P 500 index has risen 9%. However, since its Q3 earnings results, the stock has grossly under-performed. I believe some investors focused too much on iPhone unit sales and not enough on the bigger picture.\n",

      "During the quarter, Apple’s consolidated revenues reached $81.8 billion, slightly beating the expected $81.7 billion. The adjusted EPS came in at $1.26, topping the $1.19 expected. But investors focused instead on the fact that revenue total of $81.8 billion marked a marginal 1.4% year-over-year decline. Some investors were seemingly disappointed in the iPhone segment, which suffered 2.5% year-over-year drop with revenue of $39.7 billion. Given that Apple is in a refresh cycle year with the iPhone 15 set to launch, the weakness in current iPhones was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the most important aspect of the quarter were the positive side. For example, Apple's Services segment outperformed, generating $21.2 billion in revenue, surpassing the estimated $20.7 billion, all of which led to consolidated gross margins of 44.5%, reaching an all-time high. Calling this a remarkable feat would be an understatement. But it also highlights the strength of Apple’s management team and their ability to not only achieve supply chain efficiencies, but also their well-timed pivot towards the Services segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently on track to reach $100 billion in annual revenue by FY24, Apple’s Services segment, which grew 8% during the quarter, has become a dominant force, accounting for over 25% of its total revenue. But the good news didn't stop there. Apple surpassed the 1 billion paid subscribers mark.

      "\n",
      "Moreover, the business produces ridiculous amounts of free cash flow (FCF), which essentially measures the amount of cash profits a company has left over after reinvesting for growth.

That's a fair assessment, but it's worth pointing out that Apple posted double-digit revenue growth during the Great Financial Crisis more than a decade ago. And because Apple customers are generally more affluent than the average consumer, they're better equipped from a financial perspective to continue spending on tech products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Apple's strong brand will help power it through a recessionary period. It's such an obvious characteristic that it might get overlooked.

      "Besides its favorable characteristics that are obvious, Apple's shares were dirt cheap when Buffett first bought in, trading at an average trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6 during the first three months of 2016. Valuation is a priority for the Oracle of Omaha, and he was ready to pounce at the opportunity that Mr. Market offered him several years ago.\n",

      "Apple's future\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett might've first purchased Apple shares at an extremely attractive valuation, but investors on the sidelines today aren't so lucky. After its 9% drop in August, the stock is still up 36% in 2023 (as of Aug. 16). So, shares currently trade at a trailing P/E ratio of 29.9. That's not only far more expensive than Apple's average valuation over the last 10 years, but it's a huge 50% premium to the S&P 500 index's trailing P/E multiple of 20.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's market cap is roughly $2.8 trillion today, and the business generated $394 billion of revenue in fiscal 2022. A steep valuation, coupled with an already colossal enterprise, could limit growth potential going forward. Wall Street analysts seem to agree, as they forecast revenue and earnings per share to increase at an annualized pace of 6% and 8%, respectively, between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors thinking about buying shares need to consider how Apple can move the financial needle. CFO Luca Maestri stated that there are currently more than 2 billion active Apple devices across the globe. To be fair, consumers have shown a propensity to want to keep buying the company's upgrades to its popular hardware line-up. But an easy argument can be made that double-digit revenue growth might be out of the picture as we look toward the next decade, even with AR/VR initiatives and the potential for artificial intelligence to provide a lift.\n",

      "Many view ESPN as the crown jewel of Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS) TV empire. But now one prominent analyst believes that Disney will give up that crown jewel in the not-too-distant future to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wedbush's Dan Ives stated on CNBC's Last Call program last week, \"I believe it's a matter of when, not if, ESPN and Apple get together.\" Ives is cheering on a deal, recently writing to clients that it's \"a no-brainer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Apple might be motivated\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been rumors for years that Apple could acquire Disney outright. Ives doesn't think such a large transaction is likely. However, he believes that Apple would love to have ESPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has already moved into streaming TV in a major way with Apple TV+. While Apple TV+ has attracted viewers with high-quality productions such as Ted Lasso and Severance, it has also expanded into live sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "This move is already paying off nicely for Apple. MLS Season Pass subscriptions on Apple TV+ doubled since Lionel Messi joined Major League Soccer's Inter Miami franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ives argued on CNBC that \"live sports content is the golden goose.\" ESPN ranks as the longtime leader in providing live sports content at the college and professional levels. The Wedbush analyst thinks that Apple and ESPN make \"a perfect fit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Would Disney be interested in selling ESPN to Apple? Maybe not. Disney CEO Bob Iger said in the quarterly update earlier this month that the company is \"considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing, and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's possible that Apple could be the strategic partner that Disney seeks. Ives, though, believes that an outright acquisition of ESPN by Apple is more likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the right price could entice Iger to put ESPN up for sale. How much would a deal cost Apple? Probably in the ballpark of $50 billion, according to Ives.\n",
      "\n",
      "That price tag isn't too much of a stretch for Apple. The tech giant's cash stockpile totaled nearly $59 billion as of July 1. Apple is on track to generate operating cash flow of around $120 billion in its current fiscal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ives told CNBC, \"[W]e believe an acquisition could clearly happen here as we look into the next six to nine months.\" However, there are a few reasons why Apple acquiring ESPN from Disney might not be such a no-brainer deal for either company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration between ESPN and ABC (which Disney also owns) could also present a problem. Iger has stated that all options are on the table with its linear networks, including a potential sale. However, ABC's value could be lower with access to ESPN's content. If Apple acquired ESPN without also buying ABC, it could complicate matters for Disney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple could be more reluctant to fork out $50 billion or more to get ESPN than Ives thinks. The company's biggest acquisition so far was buying Beats in 2014 for $3 billion. Apple clearly hasn't been willing to pull the trigger on huge deals in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do, however, think there's one wild card that just might tip the scales in favor of Apple acquiring ESPN: Apple plans to launch its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disney's streaming service, Disney+, will be integrated with Vision Pro in several ways. The opportunities to tie in live sports with the mixed-reality device could be so appealing that Apple decides to acquire ESPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, Apple and Disney will probably work together on such integration anyway. One big hint: A video shown at Apple's 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference introducing Vision Pro showed a 3D view of a basketball game. However, if Apple owned ESPN, it would have full control over how it offers a huge array of sports content with Vision Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "So will Apple acquire ESPN? I'm not sure. Even if the deal doesn't happen, though, I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't at least walk away as the major strategic partner for ESPN that Disney says it wants. Either way, it could be good news for Apple shareholders.\n",

Apple's earnings yield, which can be found by taking the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $5.98 divided by the current stock price of $174.49, is 3.4%. While this earnings yield is lower than the 5%-plus rates available in treasuries, there's a critical difference in this earnings yield relative to T-bill yields: Apple's business is a going concern, so it will generate earnings for decades. In addition, it's a going concern likely to grow over time. One-year T-bills, on the other hand, last only one year. Further, their coupons do not grow. And since bonds eventually mature, their capital must be regularly redeployed. And there's reinvestment risk when capital is deployed because no one knows what yields will be available at that point in the future.\n",

      "But recently Apple is giving investors good reasons to bet on the company, despite the risks involved in doing so. For instance, consider how the tech giant managed to grow earnings per share 5% year over year during its most recent quarter, even as it faced substantial foreign exchange headwinds and a difficult macroeconomic environment. Growing its bottom line in a market like this makes it seem unlikely that Apple won't be able to grow its earnings meaningfully over the next five to 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, it's worth emphasizing that analysts expect Apple's earnings to grow handsomely in the coming years. Earnings growth should help support long-term stock price appreciation. On average, analysts expect Apple's earnings per share in just four years to be about 50% higher than they are today. This is the power of compounding. This is why, despite the risks and the unavoidable volatility, it might make sense for long-term investors to load up on some Apple stock today.\n",

      "In late July, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock jumped to a new all-time high and was knocking on the door of the $200-per-share mark. But Apple has not had a good August. Some of that is due to a broader sell-off in growth stocks. However, Apple's latest earnings report spooked some investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least in the short term, Apple's investment thesis is being put to the test. For the first time since 2016, Apple posted its third straight quarter of revenue decline. Despite the negative growth and the 10% sell-off over the last month, Apple stock is still up a staggering 220% over the last five years and currently sports a market premium price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.5.

      "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) held its annual meeting with shareholders on Saturday, May 6. At the time, Apple comprised 46% of Berkshire's public equity portfolio.

      "\n",
      "In response to questions about why Berkshire owns so much Apple stock, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett said, \"Our criteria for Apple isn't any different than the other businesses we own -- it just happens to be a better business than any we own.\"\n",

      "On Aug. 14, Berkshire published its quarterly 13F filing. In that filing, which represents holdings as of June 30, 2023, Berkshire's Apple position remained unchanged from the prior quarter at 915.56 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's not always a good idea to mirror the moves of famous investors, the May 6 timestamp, Buffett's commentary, and the fact that Berkshire didn't sell Apple stock in Q2 is a massive vote of confidence that the stock around its current price is still a great value. Granted, that was before it ran up close to $200 a share and reported its recent disappointing quarter. And investors will have to wait until November to see if Berkshire trimmed its position in the third quarter.

      "\n",
      "It's surprising in hindsight, but as you can see by the purple line compared to the blue line, Apple stock used to trade at the same or even below the valuation of the S&P 500 -- which is why its 10-year median P/E is so much lower than its current P/E ratio. In recent years, Apple has broken out and now fetches a sizable market premium to the S&P 500, and it is far more expensive than its former valuation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now the better question, and the question that Buffett and his team are probably asking, is whether or not Apple still has what it takes to compound growth over time for years if not decades to come. The answer is a resounding yes.\n",

      "\n",

      "“An acquisition or strategic partnership with the sports channel would be ‘a no brainer,’ wrote analyst Dan Ives. He said that buying ESPN would probably cost more than $50 billion, but would “make a ton of strategic sense” by giving Apple valuable sports content, major TV rights, and ‘change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead,” Bloomberg wrote on Aug. 17.\n",

It is hard to remember sometimes, but cell phones that functioned as mobile personal computers were a futuristic idea around fifteen years ago, and electric cars were a niche with an uncertain future as recently as five years ago. Both markets, as we now know, became massive, and the companies that had an early advantage in them grew exponentially as a result. That is already happening in AI.

Tesla’s stock surged for a while on possible future results, with massive P/Es that reflected great belief in the company, whereas Apple did not have legions of adoring fans when I started to write about them here a decade or so ago. In fact, I remember back then pointing out that a P/E of around seven, well below the market average at the time, was an opportunity to buy stock in what was already by then looking like one of history’s most successful companies at a big discount to the market. Tesla was a pure growth story, Apple was about value. At current levels, Nvidia is not as cheap as Apple was at that point, but it does have actual sales that are already showing their dominance in a growing market, much more so than Tesla had a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "What both Apple and Tesla showed is that in any tech-driven business, the beneficial impact of early success is often greater than a lot of people think it could possibly be. That success creates a strong cash position that can fund research and development of rapidly advancing technology, which gives those first to market a massive advantage over would be competitors, even big and powerful ones. A few years ago, nobody thought Tesla could beat the likes of GM (GM) and Ford (F) when it came to developing EVs, should those giants put their mind to it. In the same way, Nvidia’s critics are now saying “Ah, just wait until Microsoft (MSFT) or Google (GOOG) or whoever gets involved!”.\n",

For instance, market research firm Canalys recently pointed out that the smartphone market is showing early signs of a recovery.

      "Apple is an outstanding dividend stock despite its admittedly unimpressive yield of just 0.54%, much lower than the S&P 500's 1.54%. But that's where the disappointment ends. The tech giant has increased its dividends at a steady rate over the past 10 years, it boasts a highly conservative cash payout ratio that shows it can sustain plenty more increases, and most importantly, the dividend is backed by an incredibly resilient business with plenty of growth prospects.\n",

      "The company has become an expert at putting its own spin on existing tech and making its version extremely popular -- from the iPhone to AirPods. Apple's brand loyalty means it can charge what may sometimes seem exorbitant prices for its devices, and it continues to generate solid revenue even during challenging economic times when no one needs a new phone, much less one that costs hundreds of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Apple's most exciting growth avenues arguably lie in its services segment. The company has created a large ecosystem of more than 2 billion people who use its devices. It provides them with various services, from Apple Pay to iCloud to Apple Music. Manufacturing hardware is an expensive business that carries relatively low margins. By contrast, Apple's services unit carries much juicier margins. And as long as its ecosystem grows, Apple can find more ways to monetize its user base. Apple TV+ hasn't been around for that long. In recent years, Apple has also sought to make a stronger push within the highly promising fintech industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's just two of the most promising examples. One of the strengths of Apple's ecosystem is that it boasts high switching costs. Even something as seemingly simple as migrating data from an iPhone to an Android device can be annoying. Further, once customers are plugged into Apple's ecosystem, they get all sorts of small but useful perks they would lose by leaving. For instance, Apple's devices interact with each other in neat and surprisingly helpful ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's innovative capabilities and economic moat have been the engine behind its growth story over the past decade. The next 10 years won't be that different, in my view. Apple should make significant headway within its services segment while remaining a hardware giant. Strong revenue, earnings, and free-cash-flow growth will follow, and, of course, Apple will also reward shareholders with increasing dividends.\n",

      "While it is true that shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have sunk since the company issued its second-quarter financial results in early August, the stock has not fallen that far. Furthermore, the bleeding looks to have stopped. Over the last month, AAPL stock is down 6%. However, the share price has held above $180 and the stock is still up 40% on the year.

However, those sales decreases have been overtaken by stronger sales of the company’s services such as its App Store and Apple TV, which grew 8% on an annual basis in Q2 of this year. The company’s recent Q2 results did manage to beat Wall Street expectations, with earnings per share of $1.26 versus $1.19 that had been forecast.\n",

      "In its third quarter (ended July 1), Apple made $81.8 billion in revenue, down 1% year over year (YOY). The good news: That quarterly revenue is higher than most companies' yearly revenue (Wells Fargo, Pfizer, and Boeing, to name a few). The could-be-better news: Apple's had several consecutive quarters of negative YOY revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of Apple's lagging revenue growth can be attributed to slowing iPhone sales recently. The iPhone is Apple's foundation, accounting for more than 48% of its Q3 revenue. Unfortunately, iPhone sales were almost $1 billion less than in Q3 2022.\n",

Services are by far Apple's second-most-lucrative segment, bringing in $21.2 billion in Q3, but more encouraging is how much of Apple's total revenue it's beginning to account for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growth of Apple's services is important for a few reasons. First, regardless of how successful the iPhone is (arguably the most successful consumer product ever), having so much of your business rely on a single product isn't ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Services also have much higher margins than physical products. For each piece of hardware Apple sells, it had to incur an additional cost to make it. Generally speaking, once initial costs happen, the only additional costs from services are maintenance, support, and occasional updates. That's largely why Apple's Q3 profits were up despite declining iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is still in the early stages of its services offerings, but it's picking up steam fast -- especially in financials and healthcare. Those are two sectors that Apple has been slowly but surely making its way into (think: Apple Card and Apple Watch capabilities), but at some point, you imagine the company will put the pedal to the metal and aggressively expand in those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can call Apple's stock many things, but \"cheap\" isn't necessarily one of them. With a price-to-earnings ratio of just below 30, Apple is trading at a premium, even after its August decline. Still, long-term investors shouldn't harp too much on Apple's valuation, considering the company's growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's not seen as a dividend stock, Apple pays a $0.24 quarterly dividend. Its trailing 12-month yield is well below the S&P 500 average, but it's a true two-for-one when considering the growth potential in its stock price.\n",
      "\n",

Its hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, the AirPods wireless earbuds, the AirPods Max headphones, and the HomePod smart speaker line. Apple's software includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, the Shazam music identifier, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, and Xcode. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iMessage, and iCloud. Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card. Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days.

      "To begin with, let’s look at Apple’s performance in the June quarter. In its fiscal Q3 2023, Apple reported revenues of $81.8 billion, which was 1% lower YoY – and the third consecutive quarter where the company’s revenue fell on a yearly basis. The revenues did, however, come in slightly ahead of estimates – and so did its EPS of $1.26.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarterly beat was driven by strength in the high-margin Services business, where revenues rose 8% YoY to $21.21 billion, and Apple now boasts an installed base of over 2 billion devices, along with the prospect of recurring revenues from 1 billion paid subscriptions.\n",

      "Why AAPL Looks Like a Good Buy Now\n",
      "\n",
      "After the recent pullback, I believe Apple stock looks like a good buy right now for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "Financially strong companies like Apple tend to outperform the wider markets in periods of economic uncertainty, like the one we're in currently. AAPL, incidentally, was the best-performing FAANG stock in 2022 - and the only constituent in the elite group to outperform the Nasdaq, as investors sought shelter in financially sound companies with strong cash flows and balance sheets. After the recent sell-off, Apple’s next-12-month price-to-earnings multiple has dropped to 28.1x. While it does not appear outright cheap, it is much more reasonable than it was before earnings – and is largely in line with where the stock has traded over the last three years. The upcoming iPhone 15 launch in September could be a near-term catalyst for Apple stock. Earlier this month, Citi opened a 90-day catalyst watch on Apple, and analyst Atif Malik raised the stock's target price to $240, noting, “Recent U.S. supply chain discussions point to strong replacement cycle potential in [the] iPhone 12 installed base.” Notably, Citi’s analysis shows that since 2016, Apple shares have outperformed the S&P 500 ($SPX) every year between the release of fiscal Q3 earnings and the announcement of the iPhone in September. What’s Warren Buffett’s View on Apple Stock?\n",

While Apple’s stock price had outpaced its average target price heading into its fiscal Q3 earnings, that's no longer the case. The current average price target of $205.07 implies expected upside of 15%, while the Street-high target price of $240 is a premium of 34.6%.\n",

      "Apple is an iconic brand with appeal across the world, and 2 billion active installed devices. This vast user base is a captive market for Apple as it diversifies into multiple other industries - including the banking space, where it launched a savings account with 4.15% APY. The tech giant is also eyeing the healthcare industry, and as far back as 2019, Cook said that improving people’s health would be \"Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind.”\n",

      "Indeed, it's time for the \"E\" in P/E to catch up to the \"P.\" Some analysts, like those at Wedbush, think the coming iPhone 15 could be the product that helps give Apple a jolt.

      "These loyal, young customers are unlikely to switch to an Android product, given their distaste for those dreaded \"green bubbles.\" Further, it is tough to break out of the Apple ecosystem once you've been drawn in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, Apple has hit the spot with younger consumers. And it's these consumers who will be sticking with Apple and its lineup of products once they grow up and start earning the big bucks. Undoubtedly, the Lifetime Value (LTV) of such consumers has the potential to be incredibly high. Perhaps it's this younger audience that will be quick to embrace Apple's spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, iPhone users are more likely to try other products under the Apple umbrella (think AirPods, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch) while using various services, like iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple News. Of course, they'll also presumably be buyers of many iPhones over the decades.\n",

      "As a result, now could be an excellent time to buy the dip on one of these tech giants. So, let's assess whether Apple or AMD is the better growth stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple shares are down 9% since Aug. 1 after posting its third-quarter 2023 results, representing the third consecutive quarter of revenue declines. The company's revenue fell 1% year over year, driven by slides in three of its product segments as macroeconomic headwinds continued to curb consumer spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, market challenges won't last forever, and Apple's dominance in tech will likely provide substantial gains over the long term. The bright spot of Apple's Q3 2023 was services, which enjoyed an 8% rise in revenue. The digital business is made up of earnings from the company's subscription-based platforms, such as Apple TV+ and Music, as well as income from the App Store. The success of these services has made the segment Apple's second-highest-earning division after the iPhone, enjoying significant growth in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Apple is making promising moves in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual/augmented reality. Both industries are projected to expand at compound annual growth rates of over 30% through 2030. Meanwhile, Apple's immense brand loyalty with consumers could see it grow into leading positions in these markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's annual revenue has risen 48% since 2018, with operating income up 68%. The company has a history of solid growth, with the stature in tech to continue on its current trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Apple, AMD shares are down since the start of the month, tumbling 13%. The company's second-quarter 2023 earnings posted on Aug. 2 revealed an 18% year-over-year decline in revenue. The tumble was primarily driven by PC market challenges, which have plagued the company for the last year. Meanwhile, comparisons to chipmaker Nvidia's glowing quarterly results have only pushed AMD's stock down further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Apple or AMD the better growth stock?\n",
      "\n",
      "While AMD has solid prospects in multiple areas of tech, Apple's proven dominance in its respective markets makes it a more reliable buy. AMD is active in a highly competitive industry, going up against Nvidia, Intel, and Amazon as it strives to attract companies to its AI chips. Meanwhile, consumers have proven their preference for Apple's products over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, a study from Counterpoint Research recently revealed that smartphone shipments fell 24% year over year in Q2 2023. The declines led Samsung to experience a 37% decline in sales. However, Apple's more moderate tumble of 6% allowed it to grow its market share from 52% to 55%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple will face competition in AI. However, its efforts could flourish as it focuses on the consumer sector while many others are competing in the cloud market. Additionally, Apple could have the upper hand as it utilizes homegrown chips, allowing it to tailor its hardware directly to its software. So, if the choice is between AMD or Apple, the iPhone company is the safer and better growth stock over the long term.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet there's a reason this company has become the world's biggest (and often most profitable) since introducing the iPhone in 2007. The world loves this smartphone, and Apple has built an enormous business around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of the current bullish argument for Apple, however, isn't its iPhone revenue. It's the sustainable profits driven by the shift from being products-focused to services-focused. Although the services segment accounts for only about one-fifth of sales, it produces one-third of the company's total gross profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Apple is very good at inducing iPhone owners to spend money through apps. Although data from GlobalStats indicates there are more than twice as many Android smartphone users in the world as there are iPhone users, Sensor Tower reports iPhone owners collectively spend about twice as much money on mobile apps and games as Android owners do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the app industry market-research site Business of Apps reports that of the $17.1 billion that smartphone owners spent on recurring subscriptions last year, Apple's iOS produced 77% of it. And the company is still fine-tuning its ability to drive subscriptions among iOS users.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as the world continues its love affair with smartphones -- and the constant connection to the web they offer -- Apple will continue producing lots of profit. And its nascent efforts to employ artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to drive growth, too.\n",

Berkshire first took a stake in the Cupertino-based company in 2016, and the position has steadily snowballed over the years. Given its size today, there is only one logical interpretation: Buffett is incredibly bullish on Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple had a humdrum third quarter\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple reported mediocre financial results in the third fiscal quarter (ended July 1) despite beating expectations. The company suffered its third consecutive decline in quarterly sales as revenue dropped 1.4% year over year to $81.8 billion. That decline was driven by falling sales across the iPhone, Mac, and iPad product lines, though it was offset to some degree by strength in the services segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "CFO Luca Maestri said Apple crossed 1 billion paid subscriptions in the quarter, nearly double what it had just three years ago. Services revenue increased 8% to $21.2 billion, and because services earn higher margins than hardware, gross profit margin climbed about 120 basis points to 44.5%. That dynamic, coupled with $18 billion in share repurchases, allowed generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings to rise 5% to $1.26 per diluted share despite a decline in total revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, Apple has modest growth opportunities in hardware, but its services segment is another story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has modest growth opportunities in hardware\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has carved out meaningful market share in several consumer electronics verticals. It currently ranks as the second-largest smartphone manufacturer worldwide, but it added 700 basis points to its market share in the last five years, while the leader, Samsung, has failed to gain ground. Apple is also the largest smartwatch manufacturer in the world and the fourth-largest personal computer vendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what? The smartphone market is projected to expand at 7% annually to hit $978 billion by 2030, while the smartwatch market is forecast to increase at 8% annually to reach $72 billion during the same period. Meanwhile, the personal computer market is expected to grow at 9% annually to reach $289 billion by 2028. Apple should be able to match those growth rates at a minimum, meaning hardware revenue should grow in the mid-single digits through the end of the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Apple recently announced a virtual reality (VR) headset that will be available next year, entering a market that Grand View Research says will grow at 31% annually to reach $60 billion by 2030. If the Apple Vision Pro catches fire, hardware sales growth could outpace that mid-single-digit range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has more considerable opportunities in services\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple recently surpassed 2 billion active devices. That installed base is the foundation of its services business, which provides additional monetization opportunities through the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, as well as subscription products like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. As mentioned, the services business is growing more quickly, and it earns higher margins than the hardware business, meaning Apple should become increasingly profitable over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has a particularly strong presence in two service categories: mobile app downloads and mobile wallets. The Apple App Store holds twice as much market share as Alphabet's Google Play Store, and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet by a wide margin among U.S. consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the company is also gaining ground in digital advertising. According to eMarketer, Apple will rank as the fifth-fastest-growing digital advertiser in the U.S. this year, outpacing industry leaders Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what? Global mobile app sales are projected to climb 14% annually to reach $567 billion by 2030, while U.S. mobile wallet revenue is expected to increase 27% annually to reach $8 billion during the same period. Meanwhile, the digital ad market is forecast to grow at 9% annually to hit $1.2 trillion by 2030. Collectively, that hints at low double-digit sales growth in Apple services through the end of the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Apple stock worth buying?\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed, Apple has a reasonable shot at mid-single-digit sales growth in hardware and low double-digit sales growth in services through 2030. But earnings should grow even faster, perhaps in the mid-teens, due to rapid expansion of the high-margin services business and regular share repurchases. Indeed, Apple's earnings increased nearly 18% annually over the last five years. Yet, investors should carefully consider its valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple currently trades at 29.6 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 25.3. I question whether the company can grow quickly enough to produce market-beating returns given its current valuation, so I would recommend waiting for a more reasonable entry point. But Buffett clearly disagrees, and investors who choose to buy Apple stock today can take solace in knowing that Berkshire owns a good chunk of the company.\n",

      "September is coming, which means many things to many people. It is the month when young people fully get back to school, and when football returns in America. But for tech investors, September is most notable because it is the month when Apple (AAPL) typically unveils new iPhone models. Over time, as interest in these events has increased, speculation about what to expect from them has grown, but so has the accuracy of the forecasts. It is hard to keep a secret among thousands when millions want to know it. Thus, articles such as this one at macrumors.com, offer detailed analysis of what changes to expect when the new version of the world’s most successful electronic device are released, and they are rarely far off the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might think that with such usually accurate predictions out there for weeks, if not months, before the announcement of any actual changes, the impact of an upcoming launch on Apple stock would be minimal, but that hasn’t been the case. AAPL’s Septembers have followed a pattern for a while, with the stock dropping throughout the month, then bouncing back strongly shortly after. Sometimes, of course, there are strong macro factors that have distorted that pattern, but it has been pretty reliable, nonetheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above is a five year chart for AAPL, with each candle representing a month. As you can see, AAPL has declined in four out of the last five Septembers. Sometimes that weakness has run into early October, but before too long, it has always bounced back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, small tweaks to design and features have been Apple’s business model for decades. The brilliance of the company is that despite that, they have been able to consistently create demand for updated models. In part that is because of great marketing, but it is also a function of the way most people buy their phones. They don’t pay for the phones up front, but rather, they pay over a couple of years, then update once those payments are over. They always have a payment, and in that context, adding a few bucks a month to their bill doesn’t seem like a bad deal for even small updates and slightly improved features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those features aren’t usually “innovation” as such. They tend to be Apple’s version of others’ innovations. This time around, for example, there are strong rumors that the new iPhone will include a telescopic camera lens for better zoom and close-up photography, something that Samsung first offered a decade ago in the Galaxy S4 Zoom. That was an unwieldy phone/camera hybrid that wasn’t massively successful, and Samsung has refined the technology and styling over the last ten years. Despite that, Samsung never caught up with Apple in terms of popularity. Now, the technology is at the point where Apple feels they can offer a sleeker, better version. If history is our guide, the ten-year old idea will be greeted as “revolutionary” when Apple uses it, and will become the next visible must-have iPhone feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not being critical here. Copying but improving the technology of others is a tried and tested business model, and it is something that Apple has done better than most for twenty years or so. The performance of the stock over that time is what matters to me, and that is impressive. The S&P 500 has gained just over 400% over the last two decades, while AAPL is up close to 45,000% in the dame period. Say what you like about Apple artificially creating demand or using technology developed by others, those numbers speak for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when AAPL starts to fall as the launch approaches, as history suggests it will, know that it is a buying opportunity, not a warning. It is what has typically happened at this time of year. The cynics have been telling us for years that “This time is different. This time will be the beginning of the end for AAPL!” They have been wrong up until now, and they will be again.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, bullish investors hope this is just a temporary setback and better days are ahead. Apple is already the world's most valuable company, but can the stock reach $250 per share by the end of this year? That would translate to a roughly 40% rise from today's price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on Apple's recent performance, I don't think the outcome is impossible. However, I do think it's unlikely. Here are three reasons why investors should temper their expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most recent quarter (Q3 2023 ended July 1), Apple generated revenue of $82 billion. That's a massive figure, to be fair, but it represented a more than 1% year-over-year decline. This also comes on the heels of a sales drop in the previous two quarters. These trends are notable because, between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2022, Apple saw its sales jump at a compound annual rate of 14.9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple plans to release a new upgrade for the iPhone later this year. Maybe that product introduction can boost consumer demand. But investors must come to terms with an obvious reality. With trailing-12-month revenue of $384 billion, a valid question is how much Apple can really expand in the years ahead. If the current quarter's sales figures disappoint shareholders, the stock won't hit the $250 mark by the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to its tremendous outperformance, Apple's valuation has outpaced its earnings growth. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30. That's much more expensive than where shares sold for at the start of this year -- not surprising, given the rapid ascent in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock is also expensive from a historical perspective. In the past five years, Apple's average P/E multiple was 25. Shares are currently on the premium side of the equation, which is even more alarming, given what I discussed above about slowing growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current valuation doesn't bode well for Apple shareholders over the next four months. I believe there is more of an opportunity for investors to lose their enthusiasm -- which will crush the valuation -- than for the P/E multiple to go even higher. If the stock's performance in August is any indication, investor excitement already seems to be cooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, a weaker macroeconomic backdrop can lead to pressured consumer spending, hurting Apple's prospects. And for investors, a bearish sentiment could prevail.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apple reaching $250 per share by year-end is likely out of the question, that doesn't mean it's all bad news for investors. Apple is still one of the best businesses in the world that sells incredibly popular hardware and software products and possesses a powerful brand. That's enough reason to add the stock to your watch list, especially if the current valuation gives you pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "If investors continue selling off shares throughout the rest of the year due to the factors mentioned above, Apple will likely end 2023 at a lower price than where it currently trades. However, it's anyone's guess what happens next. Still, given the stock's strong performance, I think it's best to temper expectations.\n",

      "Apple also maintained its dividend payout for shareholders, announcing a payout of 24 cents per share.

      "Apple is struggling because of weak consumer demand\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is an easier business to understand than Microsoft. Apple is a consumer-facing company that provides leading technology like iPhones, laptops, and now a virtual reality (VR) headset. Microsoft is a bit more complicated, as it has its hands in multiple markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's product net isn't nearly as wide as Microsoft's, which doesn't bode as well when assessing potential growth. We're already seeing the effects of that now, as the average consumer isn't spending nearly as much on discretionary items that Apple creates, translating directly to its 1.4% revenue decline in the third quarter (ending July 1), its third straight quarterly revenue decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "But during good times, Apple's consumer products can shine, so investors should be careful about extrapolating short-term results over a much longer period. With Microsoft's diverse product base, it can excel in good times while also delivering solid results when consumer demand is weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft's growth plan is stronger than Apple's\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., Apple is king. It holds a 58% market share in the U.S. smartphone market but holds an even more important audience captive: ages 18 to 24. Bloomberg Intelligence found that 79% of those surveyed in that demographic preferred the iOS operating system, indicating Apple has won over a younger audience. Internationally, Apple only holds a 17% market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while domestic growth is still possible, Apple's primary focus must be international expansion if it hopes to beat Microsoft to a $5 trillion valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you apply that logic to Apple, can it double or triple its sales of iPhones, AirPods, or Apple TV subscriptions? I'd say it's possible, but it's far from the certainty of Microsoft's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "But does Apple have too big of a head start?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both companies have seen a large pullback with the broader market over the past month, but Microsoft is only $400 billion behind Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the long term, that disadvantage means Microsoft will need to grow 108% to reach $5 trillion, while Apple only has to grow 79%. Both growth rates are attainable by 2030, so I think we'll see a $5 trillion company by then.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for which will be first, I think it will be Microsoft, hands down. Cloud computing is a massive market and will receive a boost from technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), which require massive amounts of data. Smartphones and other consumer tech are fairly prevalent, so while Apple may be successful, Microsoft looks like the better long-term pick.\n",

      "Aug 30 (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O is testing 3D printers to make the steel frames of some of its upcoming smartwatches, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approach has the potential to streamline Apple's supply chain and if the tests with the Apple watches are successful, the company will look to use the technology on more products over the next several years, the report added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is set to host their fall event on Sept. 12, where analysts believe the world's most valuable company will unveil a new line of smartwatches and iPhones.\n",

      "The major indexes managed to eke out a fourth-straight daily gain. After a tumultuous monthly performance, investors head into the last day of August trading tomorrow, after spending most of today near breakeven and digesting several bouts of economic and jobs data. Chip stocks aided today's win, including Apple (AAPL) as it sent out invites to its Sept. 12 annual launch conference.\n",

      "Our Theme of Apple Component Supplier Stocks, which includes a diverse set of companies that supply components for Apple’s devices, has gained about 12% year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500 which remains up by 15% and Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has gained about 40% year-to-date. Now, Apple’s recent performance has actually been pretty mixed. Over Q3 FY’23, the most recently reported quarter, the company saw overall revenues shrink year-over-year, as demand for core computing products including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac fell as tailwinds seen through Covid-19 eased. Major suppliers like Jabil and Qorvo have seen revenue decline or flatten year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, AAPL stock had a Sharpe Ratio of 1.1 since early 2017, which is higher than the figure of 0.6 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Compare this with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, there are some near-term positives for the theme. Apple is slated to unveil its next-generation iPhones sometime in early September. The new smartphone is expected to feature meaningful upgrades and possibly design changes versus the iPhone 14, boding well for suppliers from a component content per-device perspective. Multiple reports indicate that Apple will raise pricing on the Pro devices by $100 to $200 this time around, implying that prices for Apple’s flagship phones will start at as much as $1,200. This is long overdue, given that Apple has held the starting price of its premium devices at $1,000 over the last six years. Higher average iPhone prices should give suppliers some more room to negotiate better deals with Apple. Separately, the supply chain issues faced by semiconductor players through Covid-19 is also easing, and this could also help the theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within our theme, Jabil stock (NYSE:JBL), a company known for making casings for Apple’s iDevices, has been the strongest performer, rising by about 67% year-to-date. On the other side, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) – which supplies semiconductor components for the iPhone – has been one of the weaker performers with its stock up by just about 3% year-to-date.\n",
